    "content": "A Game Of Thrones \nBook One of A Song of Ice and Fire \nBy George R. R. Martin \nPROLOGUE \n\"We should start back,\" Gared urged as the woods began to grow dark around them. \"The wildlings are \ndead.\" \n\"Do the dead frighten you?\" Ser Waymar Royce asked with just the hint of a smile. \nGared did not rise to the bait. He was an old man, past fifty, and he had seen the lordlings come and go. \n\"Dead is dead,\" he said. \"We have no business with the dead.\" \n\"Are they dead?\" Royce asked softly. \"What proof have we?\" \n\"Will saw them,\" Gared said. \"If he says they are dead, that's proof enough for me.\" \nWill had known they would drag him into the quarrel sooner or later. He wished it had been later rather \nthan sooner. \"My mother told me that dead men sing no songs,\" he put in. \n\"My wet nurse said the same thing, Will,\" Royce replied. \"Never believe anything you hear at a woman's \ntit. There are things to be learned even from the dead.\" His voice echoed, too loud in the twilit forest. \nPage 1\n\n\"We have a long ride before us,\" Gared pointed out. \"Eight days, maybe nine. And night is falling.\" \nSer Waymar Royce glanced at the sky with disinterest. \"It does that every day about this time. Are you \nunmanned by the dark, Gared?\" \nWill could see the tightness around Gared's mouth, the barely sup \npressed anger in his eyes under the thick black hood of his cloak. Gared had spent forty years in the \nNight's Watch, man and boy, and he was not accustomed to being made light of. Yet it was more than \nthat. Under the wounded pride, Will could sense something else in the older man. You could taste it; a \nnervous tension that came perilous close to fear. \nWill shared his unease. He had been four years on the Wall. The first time he had been sent beyond, all \nthe old stories had come rushing back, and his bowels had turned to water. He had laughed about it \nafterward. He was a veteran of a hundred rangings by now, and the endless dark wilderness that the \nsouthron called the haunted forest had no more terrors for him. \nUntil tonight. Something was different tonight. There was an edge to this darkness that made his hackles \nrise. Nine days they had been riding, north and northwest and then north again, farther and farther from \nthe Wall, hard on the track of a band of wildling raiders. Each day had been worse than the day that had \ncome before it. Today was the worst of all. A cold wind was blowing out of the north, and it made the \ntrees rustle like living things. All day, Will had felt as though something were watching him, something \ncold and implacable that loved him not. Gared had felt it too. Will wanted nothing so much as to ride \nhellbent for the safety of the Wall, but that was not a feeling to share with your commander. \nEspecially not a commander like this one. \nSer Waymar Royce was the youngest son of an ancient house with too many heirs. He was a handsome \nyouth of eighteen, grey-eyed and graceful and slender as a knife. Mounted on his huge black destrier, the \nknight towered above Will and Gared on their smaller garrons. He wore black leather boots, black \nwoolen pants, black moleskin gloves, and a fine supple coat of gleaming black ringmail over layers of \nblack wool and boiled leather. Ser Waymar had been a Sworn Brother of the Night's Watch for less than \nhalf a year, but no one could say he had not prepared for his vocation. At least insofar as his wardrobe \nwas concerned. \nHis cloak was his crowning glory; sable, thick and black and soft as sin. \"Bet he killed them all himself, \nhe did,\" Gared told the barracks over wine, \"twisted their little heads off, our mighty warrior.\" They had \nall shared the laugh. \nIt is hard to take orders from a man you laughed at in your cups, Will reflected as he sat shivering atop \nhis garron. Gared must have felt the same. \n\"Mormont said as we should track them, and we did,\" Gared said. \n\"They're dead. They shan't trouble us no more. There's hard riding before us. I don't like this weather. If \nit snows, we could be a fortnight getting back, and snow's the best we can hope for. Ever seen an ice \nstorm, my lord?\" \nThe lordling seemed not to hear him. He studied the deepening twilight in that half-bored, half-distracted \nPage 2\n\nway he had. Will had ridden with the knight long enough to understand that it was best not to interrupt \nhim when he looked like that. \"Tell me again what you saw, Will. All the details. Leave nothing out.\" \nWill had been a hunter before he joined the Night's Watch. Well, a poacher in truth. Mallister freeriders \nhad caught him red-handed in the Mallisters' own woods, skinning one of the Mallisters' own bucks, and \nit had been a choice of putting on the black or losing a hand. No one could move through the woods as \nsilent as Will, and it had not taken the black brothers long to discover his talent. \n\"The camp is two miles farther on, over that ridge, hard beside a stream,\" Will said. \"I got close as I \ndared. There's eight of them, men and women both. No children I could see. They put up a lean-to \nagainst the rock. The snow's pretty well covered it now, but I could still make it out. No fire burning, but \nthe firepit was still plain as day. No one moving. I watched a long time. No living man ever lay so still.\" \n\"Did you see any blood?\" \n\"Well, no,\" Will admitted. \n\"Did you see any weapons?\" \n\"Some swords, a few bows. One man had an axe. Heavy-looking, double-bladed, a cruel piece of iron. \nIt was on the ground beside him, right by his hand.\" \n\"Did you make note of the position of the bodies?\" \nWill shrugged. \"A couple are sitting up against the rock. Most of them on the ground. Fallen, like.\" \n\"Or sleeping,\" Royce suggested. \n\"Fallen,\" Will insisted. \"There's one woman up an ironwood, halfhid in the branches. A far-eyes.\" He \nsmiled thinly. \"I took care she never saw me. When I got closer, I saw that she wasn't moving neither.\" \nDespite himself, he shivered. \n\"You have a chill?\" Royce asked. \n\"Some,\" Will muttered. \"The wind, m'lord.\" \nThe young knight turned back to his grizzled man-at-arms. Frostfallen leaves whispered past them, and \nRoyce's destrier moved restlessly. \"What do you think might have killed these men, Gared?\" Ser \nWaymar asked casually. He adjusted the drape of his long sable cloak. \n\"It was the cold,\" Gared said with iron certainty. \"I saw men freeze \nlast winter, and the one before, when I was half a boy. Everyone talks about snows forty foot deep, and \nhow the ice wind comes howling out of the north, but the real enemy is the cold. It steals up on you \nquieter than Will, and at first you shiver and your teeth chatter and you stamp your feet and dream of \nmulled wine and nice hot fires. It burns, it does. Nothing burns like the cold. But only for a while. Then it \ngets inside you and starts to fill you up, and after a while you don't have the strength to fight it. It's easier \njust to sit down or go to sleep. They say you don't feel any pain toward the end. First you go weak and \ndrowsy, and everything starts to fade, and then it's like sinking into a sea of warm milk. Peaceful, like.\" \n\"Such eloquence, Gared,\" Ser Waymar observed. \"I never suspected you had it in you.\" \nPage 3\n\n\"I've had the cold in me too, lordling.\" Gared pulled back his hood, giving Ser Waymar a good long look \nat the stumps where his ears had been. \"Two ears, three toes, and the little finger off my left hand. I got \noff light. We found my brother frozen at his watch, with a smile on his face.\" \nSer Waymar shrugged. \"You ought dress more warmly, Gared.\" \nGared glared at the lordling, the scars around his ear holes flushed red with anger where Maester \nAemon had cut the ears away. \"We'll see how warm you can dress when the winter comes.\" He pulled \nup his hood and hunched over his garron, silent and sullen. \n\"If Gared said it was the cold . . .\" Will began. \n\"Have you drawn any watches this past week, Will?\" \n\"Yes, m'lord.\" There never was a week when he did not draw a dozen bloody watches. What was the \nman driving at? \n\"And how did you find the Wall?\" \n\"Weeping,\" Will said, frowning. He saw it clear enough, now that the lordling had pointed it out. \"They \ncouldn't have froze. Not if the Wall was weeping. It wasn't cold enough.\" \nRoyce nodded. \"Bright lad. We've had a few light frosts this past week, and a quick flurry of snow now \nand then, but surely no cold fierce enough to kill eight grown men. Men clad in fur and leather, let me \nremind you, with shelter near at hand, and the means of making fire.\" The knight's smile was cocksure. \n\"Will, lead us there. I would see these dead men for myself.\" \nAnd then there was nothing to be done for it. The order had been given, and honor bound them to obey. \nWill went in front, his shaggy little garron picking the way carefully through the undergrowth. A light \nsnow had fallen the night before, and there were stones and roots and hidden sinks lying just under its \ncrust, waiting for the careless and the unwary. Ser Waymar Royce came next, his great black destrier \nsnorting impatiently. The warhorse was the wrong mount for ranging, but try and tell that to the lordling. \nGared brought up the rear. The old man-at-arms muttered to himself as he rode. \nTwilight deepened. The cloudless sky turned a deep purple, the color of an old bruise, then faded to \nblack. The stars began to come out. A half-moon rose. Will was grateful for the light. \n\"We can make a better pace than this, surely,\" Royce said when the moon was full risen. \n\"Not with this horse,\" Will said. Fear had made him insolent. \"Perhaps my lord would care to take the \nlead?\" \nSer Waymar Royce did not deign to reply. \nSomewhere off in the wood a wolf howled. \nWill pulled his garron over beneath an ancient gnarled ironwood and dismounted. \nPage 4\n\n\"Why are you stopping?\" Ser Waymar asked. \n\"Best go the rest of the way on foot, m'lord. It's just over that ridge.\" \nRoyce paused a moment, staring off into the distance, his face reflective. A cold wind whispered through \nthe trees. His great sable cloak stirred behind like something half-alive. \n\"There's something wrong here,\" Gared muttered. \nThe young knight gave him a disdainful smile. \"Is there?\" \n\"Can't you feel it?\" Gared asked. \"Listen to the darkness.\" \nWill could feel it. Four years in the Night's Watch, and he had never been so afraid. What was it? \n\"Wind. Trees rustling. A wolf. Which sound is it that unmans you so, Gared?\" When Gared did not \nanswer, Royce slid gracefully from his saddle. He tied the destrier securely to a low-hanging limb, well \naway from the other horses, and drew his longsword from its sheath. Jewels glittered in its hilt, and the \nmoonlight ran down the shining steel. It was a splendid weapon, castle-forged, and new-made from the \nlook of it. Will doubted it had ever been swung in anger. \n\"The trees press close here,\" Will warned. \"That sword will tangle you up, m1ord. Better a knife.\" \n\"If I need instruction, I will ask for it,\" the young lord said. \"Gared, stay here. Guard the horses.\" \nGared dismounted. \"We need a fire. I'll see to it.\" \n\"How big a fool are you, old man? If there are enemies in this wood, a fire is the last thing we want.\" \n\"There's some enemies a fire will keep away,\" Gared said. \"Bears and direwolves and ... and other \nthings . . .\" \nSer Waymar's mouth became a hard line. \"No fire.\" \nGared's hood shadowed his face, but Will could see the hard glitter in his eyes as he stared at the knight. \nFor a moment he was afraid the older man would go for his sword. It was a short, ugly thing, its grip \ndiscolored by sweat, its edge nicked from hard use, but Will would not have given an iron bob for the \nlordling's life if Gared pulled it from its scabbard. \nFinally Gared looked down. \"No fire,\" he muttered, low under his breath. \nRoyce took it for acquiescence and turned away. \"Lead on,\" he said to Will. \nWill threaded their way through a thicket, then started up the slope to the low ridge where he had found \nhis vantage point under a sentinel tree. Under the thin crust of snow, the ground was damp and muddy, \nslick footing, with rocks and hidden roots to trip you up. Will made no sound as he climbed. Behind him, \nhe heard the soft metallic slither of the lordling's ringmail, the rustle of leaves, and muttered curses as \nreaching branches grabbed at his longsword and tugged on his splendid sable cloak. \nThe great sentinel was right there at the top of the ridge, where Will had known it would be, its lowest \nbranches a bare foot off the ground. Will slid in underneath, flat on his belly in the snow and the mud, and \nPage 5\n\nlooked down on the empty clearing below. \nHis heart stopped in his chest. For a moment he dared not breathe. Moonlight shone down on the \nclearing, the ashes of the firepit, the snow-covered lean-to, the great rock, the little half-frozen stream. \nEverything was just as it had been a few hours ago. \nThey were gone. All the bodies were gone. \n\"Gods!\" he heard behind him. A sword slashed at a branch as Ser Waymar Royce gained the ridge. He \nstood there beside the sentinel, longsword in hand, his cloak billowing behind him as the wind came up, \noutlined nobly against the stars for all to see. \n\"Get down!\" Will whispered urgently. \"Something's wrong.\" \nRoyce did not move. He looked down at the empty clearing and laughed. \"Your dead men seem to have \nmoved camp, Will.\" \nWill's voice abandoned him. He groped for words that did not come. It was not possible. His eyes \nswept back and forth over the abandoned campsite, stopped on the axe. A huge double-bladed \nbattle-axe, still lying where he had seen it last, untouched. A valuable weapon . . . \n\"On your feet, Will,\" Ser Waymar commanded. \"There's no one here. I won't have you hiding under a \nbush.\" \nReluctantly, Will obeyed. \nSer Waymar looked him over with open disapproval. \"I am not going back to Castle Black a failure on \nmy first ranging. We will find these men.\" He glanced around. \"Up the tree. Be quick about it. Look for a \nfire.\" \nWill turned away, wordless. There was no use to argue. The wind was moving. It cut right through him. \nHe went to the tree, a vaulting grey-green sentinel, and began to climb. Soon his hands were sticky with \nsap, and he was lost among the needles. Fear filled his gut like a meal he could not digest. He whispered \na prayer to the nameless gods of the wood, and slipped his dirk free of its sheath. He put it between his \nteeth to keep both hands free for climbing. The taste of cold iron in his mouth gave him comfort. \nDown below, the lordling called out suddenly, \"Who goes there?\" Will heard uncertainty in the challenge. \nHe stopped climbing; he listened; he watched. \nThe woods gave answer: the rustle of leaves, the icy rush of the stream, a distant hoot of a snow owl. \nThe Others made no sound. \nWill saw movement from the corner of his eye. Pale shapes gliding through the wood. He turned his \nhead, glimpsed a white shadow in the darkness. Then it was gone. Branches stirred gently in the wind, \nscratching at one another with wooden fingers. Will opened his mouth to call down a warning, and the \nwords seemed to freeze in his throat. Perhaps he was wrong. Perhaps it had only been a bird, a reflection \non the snow, some trick of the moonlight. What had he seen, after all? \n\"Will, where are you?\" Ser Waymar called up. \"Can you see anything?\" He was turning in a slow circle, \nsuddenly wary, his sword in hand. He must have felt them, as Will felt them. There was nothing to see. \nPage 6\n\n\"Answer me! Why is it so cold?\" \nIt was cold. Shivering, Will clung more tightly to his perch. His face pressed hard against the trunk of the \nsentinel. He could feel the sweet, sticky sap on his cheek. \nA shadow emerged from the dark of the wood. It stood in front of Royce. Tall, it was, and gaunt and \nhard as old bones, with flesh pale as milk. Its armor seemed to change color as it moved; here it was \nwhite as new-fallen snow, there black as shadow, everywhere dappled with the deep grey-green of the \ntrees. The patterns ran like moonlight on water with every step it took. \nWill heard the breath go out of Ser Waymar Royce in a long hiss. \n\"Come no farther,\" the lordling warned. His voice cracked like a boy's. He threw the long sable cloak \nback over his shoulders, to free his arms for battle, and took his sword in both hands. The wind had \nstopped. It was very cold. \nThe Other slid forward on silent feet. In its hand was a longsword like none that Will had ever seen. No \nhuman metal had gone into the forging of that blade. It was alive with moonlight, translucent, a shard of \ncrystal so thin that it seemed almost to vanish when seen edge-on. There was a faint blue shimmer to the \nthing, a ghost-light that played around its edges, and somehow Will knew it was sharper than any razor. \nSer Waymar met him bravely. \"Dance with me then.\" He lifted his sword high over his head, defiant. His \nhands trembled from the weight of it, or perhaps from the cold. Yet in that moment, Will thought, he was \na boy no longer, but a man of the Night's Watch. \nThe Other halted. Will saw its eyes; blue, deeper and bluer than any human eyes, a blue that burned like \nice. They fixed on the longsword trembling on high, watched the moonlight running cold along the metal. \nFor a heartbeat he dared to hope. \nThey emerged silently from the shadows, twins to the first. Three of them . . . four . . . five . . . Ser \nWaymar may have felt the cold that came with them, but he never saw them, never heard them. Will had \nto call out. It was his duty. And his death, if he did. He shivered, and hugged the tree, and kept the \nsilence. \nThe pale sword came shivering through the air. \nSer Waymar met it with steel. When the blades met, there was no ring of metal on metal; only a high, \nthin sound at the edge of hearing, like an animal screaming in pain. Royce checked a second blow, and a \nthird, then fell back a step. Another flurry of blows, and he fell back again. \nBehind him, to right, to left, all around him, the watchers stood patient, faceless, silent, the shifting \npatterns of their delicate armor making them all but invisible in the wood. Yet they made no move to \ninterfere. \nAgain and again the swords met, until Will wanted to cover his ears against the strange anguished \nkeening of their clash. Ser Waymar was panting from the effort now, his breath steaming in the moonlight. \nHis blade was white with frost; the Other's danced with pale blue light. \nThen Royce's parry came a beat too late. The pale sword bit through the ringmail beneath his arm. The \nyoung lord cried out in pain. Blood welled between the rings. It steamed in the cold, and the droplets \nseemed red as fire where they touched the snow. Ser \nPage 7\n\nWaymar's fingers brushed his side. His moleskin glove came away soaked with red. \nThe Other said something in a language that Will did not know; his voice was like the cracking of ice on \na winter lake, and the words were mocking. \nSer Waymar Royce found his fury. \"For Robert!\" he shouted, and he came up snarling, lifting the \nfrost-covered longsword with both hands and swinging it around in a flat sidearm slash with all his weight \nbehind it. The Other's parry was almost lazy. \nWhen the blades touched, the steel shattered. \nA scream echoed through the forest night, and the longsword shivered into a hundred brittle pieces, the \nshards scattering like a rain of needles. Royce went to his knees, shrieking, and covered his eyes. Blood \nwelled between his fingers. \nThe watchers moved forward together, as if some signal had been given. Swords rose and fell, all in a \ndeathly silence. It was cold butchery. The pale blades sliced through ringmail as if it were silk. Will closed \nhis eyes. Far beneath him, he heard their voices and laughter sharp as icicles. \nWhen he found the courage to look again, a long time had passed, and the ridge below was empty. \nHe stayed in the tree, scarce daring to breathe, while the moon crept slowly across the black sky. \nFinally, his muscles cramping and his fingers numb with cold, he climbed down. \nRoyce's body lay facedown in the snow, one arm outflung. The thick sable cloak had been slashed in a \ndozen places. Lying dead like that, you saw how young he was. A boy. \nHe found what was left of the sword a few feet away, the end splintered and twisted like a tree struck \nby lightning. Will knelt, looked around warily, and snatched it up. The broken sword would be his proof. \nGared would know what to make of it, and if not him, then surely that old bear Mormont or Maester \nAemon. Would Gared still be waiting with the horses? He had to hurry. \nWill rose. Ser Waymar Royce stood over him. \nHis fine clothes were a tatter, his face a ruin. A shard from his sword transfixed the blind white pupil of \nhis left eye. \nThe right eye was open. The pupil burned blue. It saw. \nThe broken sword fell from nerveless fingers. Will closed his eyes to pray. Long, elegant hands brushed \nhis cheek, then tightened around his throat. They were gloved in the finest moleskin and sticky with \nblood, yet the touch was icy cold. \nBRAN \nThe morning had dawned clear and cold, with a crispness that hinted at the end of summer. They set \nforth at daybreak to see a man beheaded, twenty in all, and Bran rode among them, nervous with \nexcitement. This was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord father and his \nPage 8\n\nbrothers to see the king's justice done. It was the ninth year of summer, and the seventh of Bran's life. \nThe man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills. Robb thought he was a wildling, his sword \nsworn to Mance Rayder, the Kingbeyond-the-Wall. It made Bran's skin prickle to think of it. He \nremembered the hearth tales Old Nan told them. The wildlings were cruel men, she said, slavers and \nslayers and thieves. They consorted with giants and ghouls, stole girl children in the dead of night, and \ndrank blood from polished horns. And their women lay with the Others in the Long Night to sire terrible \nhalf-human children. \nBut the man they found bound hand and foot to the holdfast wall awaiting the king's justice was old and \nscrawny, not much taller than Robb. He had lost both ears and a finger to frostbite, and he dressed all in \nblack, the same as a brother of the Night's Watch, except that his furs were ragged and greasy. \nThe breath of man and horse mingled, steaming, in the cold morning air as his lord father had the man cut \ndown from the wall and \ndragged before them. Robb and Jon sat tall and still on their horses, with Bran between them on his \npony, trying to seem older than seven, trying to pretend that he'd seen all this before. A faint wind blew \nthrough the holdfast gate. Over their heads flapped the banner of the Starks of Winterfell: a grey direwolf \nracing across an ice-white field. \nBran's father sat solemnly on his horse, long brown hair stirring in the wind. His closely trimmed beard \nwas shot with white, making him look older than his thirty-five years. He had a grim cast to his grey eyes \nthis day, and he seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of \nthe age of heroes and the children of the forest. He had taken off Father's face, Bran thought, and \ndonned the face of Lord Stark of Winterfell. \nThere were questions asked and answers given there in the chill of morning, but afterward Bran could \nnot recall much of what had been said. Finally his lord father gave a command, and two of his guardsmen \ndragged the ragged man to the ironwood stump in the center of the square. They forced his head down \nonto the hard black wood. Lord Eddard Stark dismounted and his ward Theon Greyjoy brought forth \nthe sword. \"Ice,\" that sword was called. It was as wide across as a man's hand, and taller even than \nRobb. The blade was Valyrian steel, spell-forged and dark as smoke. Nothing held an edge like Valyrian \nsteel. \nHis father peeled off his gloves and handed them to Jory Cassel, the captain of his household guard. He \ntook hold of Ice with both hands and said, \"In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of \nhis Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and \nProtector of the Realm, by the word of Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of \nthe North, I do sentence you to die.\" He lifted the greatsword high above his head. \nBran's bastard brother Jon Snow moved closer. \"Keep the pony well in hand,\" he whispered. \"And \ndon't look away. Father will know if you do.\" \nBran kept his pony well in hand, and did not look away. \nHis father took off the man's head with a single sure stroke. Blood sprayed out across the snow, as red \nas surnmerwine. One of the horses reared and had to be restrained to keep from bolting. Bran could not \ntake his eyes off the blood. The snows around the stump drank it eagerly, reddening as he watched. \nThe head bounced off a thick root and rolled. It came up near Greyjoy's feet. Theon was a lean, dark \nPage 9\n\nyouth of nineteen who found \neverything amusing. He laughed, put his boot on the head, and kicked it away. \n\"Ass,\" Jon muttered, low enough so Greyjoy did not hear. He put a hand on Bran's shoulder, and Bran \nlooked over at his bastard brother. \"You did well,\" Jon told him solemnly. Jon was fourteen, an old hand \nat justice. \nIt seemed colder on the long ride back to Winterfell, though the wind had died by then and the sun was \nhigher in the sky. Bran rode with his brothers, well ahead of the main party, his pony struggling hard to \nkeep up with their horses. \n\"The deserter died bravely,\" Robb said. He was big and broad and growing every day, with his mother's \ncoloring, the fair skin, red-brown hair, and blue eyes of the Tullys of Riverrun. \"He had courage, at the \nleast.\" \n\"No,\" Jon Snow said quietly. \"It was not courage. This one was dead of fear. You could see it in his \neyes, Stark.\" Jon's eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black, but there was little they did not \nsee. He was of an age with Robb, but they did not look alike. Jon was slender where Robb was \nmuscular, dark where Robb was fair, graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast. \nRobb was not impressed. \"The Others take his eyes,\" he swore. \"He died well. Race you to the bridge?\" \n\"Done,\" Jon said, kicking his horse forward. Robb cursed and followed, and they galloped off down the \ntrail, Robb laughing and hooting, Jon silent and intent. The hooves of their horses kicked up showers of \nsnow as they went. \nBran did not try to follow. His pony could not keep up. He had seen the ragged man's eyes, and he was \nthinking of them now. After a while, the sound of Robb's laughter receded, and the woods grew silent \nagain. \nSo deep in thought was he that he never heard the rest of the party until his father moved up to ride \nbeside him. \"Are you well, Bran?\" he asked, not unkindly. \n\"Yes, Father,\" Bran told him. He looked up. Wrapped in his furs and leathers, mounted on his great \nwarhorse, his lord father loomed over him like a giant. \"Robb says the man died bravely, but Jon says he \nwas afraid.\" \n\"What do you think?\" his father asked. \nBran thought about it. \"Can a man still be brave if he's afraid?\" \n\"That is the only time a man can be brave,\" his father told him. \"Do you understand why I did it?\" \n\"He was a wildling,\" Bran said. \"They carry off women and sell them to the Others.\" \nHis lord father smiled. \"Old Nan has been telling you stories again. In truth, the man was an oathbreaker, \na deserter from the Night's Watch. No man is more dangerous. The deserter knows his life is forfeit if he \nis taken, so he will not flinch from any crime, no matter how vile. But you mistake me. The question was \nnot why the man had to die, but why I must do it.\" \nPage 10\n\nBran had no answer for that. \"King Robert has a headsman,\" he said, uncertainly. \n\"He does,\" his father admitted. \"As did the Targaryen kings before him. Yet our way is the older way. \nThe blood of the First Men still flows in the veins of the Starks, and we hold to the belief that the man \nwho passes the sentence should swing the sword. If you would take a man's life, you owe it to him to \nlook into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does \nnot deserve to die. \n\"One day, Bran, you will be Robb's bannerman, holding a keep of your own for your brother and your \nking, and justice will fall to you. When that day comes, you must take no pleasure in the task, but neither \nmust you look away. A ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is.\" \nThat was when Jon reappeared on the crest of the hill before them. He waved and shouted down at \nthem. \"Father, Bran, come quickly, see what Robb has found!\" Then he was gone again. \nJory rode up beside them. \"Trouble, my lord?\" \n\"Beyond a doubt,\" his lord father said. \"Come, let us see what mischief my sons have rooted out now.\" \nHe sent his horse into a trot. Jory and Bran and the rest came after. \nThey found Robb on the riverbank north of the bridge, with Jon still mounted beside him. The late \nsummer snows had been heavy this moonturn. Robb stood knee-deep in white, his hood pulled back so \nthe sun shone in his hair. He was cradling something in his arm, while the boys talked in hushed, excited \nvoices. \nThe riders picked their way carefully through the drifts, groping for solid footing on the hidden, uneven \nground. Jory Cassel and Theon Greyjoy were the first to reach the boys. Greyjoy was laughing and \njoking as he rode. Bran heard the breath go out of him. \"Gods!\" he exclaimed, struggling to keep control \nof his horse as he reached for his sword. \nJory's sword was already out. \"Robb, get away from it!\" he called as his horse reared under him. \nRobb grinned and looked up from the bundle in his arms. \"She can't hurt you,\" he said. \"She's dead, \nJory.\" \nBran was afire with curiosity by then. He would have spurred the pony faster, but his father made them \ndismount beside the bridge and approach on foot. Bran jumped off and ran. \nBy then Jon, Jory, and Theon Greyjoy had all dismounted as well. \"What in the seven hells is it?\" \nGreyjoy was saying. \n\"A wolf,\" Robb told him. \n\"A freak,\" Greyjoy said. \"Look at the size of it.\" \nBran's heart was thumping in his chest as he pushed through a waist-high drift to his brothers' side. \nHalf-buried in bloodstained snow, a huge dark shape slumped in death. Ice had formed in its shaggy \ngrey fur, and the faint smell of corruption clung to it like a woman's perfume. Bran glimpsed blind eyes \ncrawling with maggots, a wide mouth full of yellowed teeth. But it was the size of it that made him gasp. It \nwas bigger than his pony, twice the size of the largest hound in his father's kennel. \nPage 11\n\n\"It's no freak,\" Jon said calmly. \"That's a direwolf. They grow larger than the other kind.\" \nTheon Greyjoy said, \"There's not been a direwolf sighted south of the Wall in two hundred years.\" \n\"I see one now,\" Jon replied. \nBran tore his eyes away from the monster. That was when he noticed the bundle in Robb's arms. He \ngave a cry of delight and moved closer. The pup was a tiny ball of grey-black fur, its eyes still closed. It \nnuzzled blindly against Robb's chest as he cradled it, searching for milk among his leathers, making a sad \nlittle whimpery sound. Bran reached out hesitantly. \"Go on,\" Robb told him. \"You can touch him.\" \nBran gave the pup a quick nervous stroke, then turned as Jon said, \"Here you go.\" His half brother put a \nsecond pup into his arms. \"There are five of them.\" Bran sat down in the snow and hugged the wolf pup \nto his face. Its fur was soft and warm against his cheek. \n\"Direwolves loose in the realm, after so many years,\" muttered Hullen, the master of horse. \"I like it not.\" \n\"It is a sign,\" Jory said. \nFather frowned. \"This is only a dead animal, Jory,\" he said. Yet he seemed troubled. Snow crunched \nunder his boots as he moved around the body. \"Do we know what killed her?\" \n\"There's something in the throat,\" Robb told him, proud to have found the answer before his father even \nasked. \"There, just under the jaw.,, \nHis father knelt and groped under the beast's head with his hand. \nHe gave a yank and held it up for all to see. A foot of shattered antler, tines snapped off, all wet with \nblood. \nA sudden silence descended over the party. The men looked at the antler uneasily, and no one dared to \nspeak. Even Bran could sense their fear, though he did not understand. \nHis father tossed the antler to the side and cleansed his hands in the snow. \"I'm surprised she lived long \nenough to whelp,\" he said. His voice broke the spell. \n\"Maybe she didn't,\" Jory said. \"I've heard tales . . . maybe the bitch was already dead when the pups \ncame.\" \n\"Born with the dead,\" another man put in. \"Worse luck.\" \n\"No matter,\" said Hullen. \"They be dead soon enough too.\" \nBran gave a wordless cry of dismay. \n\"The sooner the better,\" Theon Greyjoy agreed. He drew his sword. \"Give the beast here, Bran.\" \nThe little thing squirmed against him, as if it heard and understood. \"No!\" Bran cried out fiercely. \"It's \nmine.\" \nPage 12\n\n\"Put away your sword, Greyjoy,\" Robb said. For a moment he sounded as commanding as their father, \nlike the lord he would someday be. \"We will keep these pups.\" \n\"You cannot do that, boy,\" said Harwin, who was Hullen's son. \n\"It be a mercy to kill them,\" Hullen said. \nBran looked to his lord father for rescue, but got only a frown, a furrowed brow. \"Hullen speaks truly, \nson. Better a swift death than a hard one from cold and starvation.\" \n\"No!\" He could feel tears welling in his eyes, and he looked away. He did not want to cry in front of his \nfather. \nRobb resisted stubbornly. \"Ser Rodrik's red bitch whelped again last week,\" he said. \"It was a small \nlitter, only two live pups. She'll have milk enough.\" \n\"She'll rip them apart when they try to nurse.\" \n\"Lord Stark,\" Jon said. It was strange to hear him call Father that, so formal. Bran looked at him with \ndesperate hope. \"There are five pups,\" he told Father. \"Three male, two female.\" \n\"What of it, Jon?\" \n\"You have five trueborn children,\" Jon said. \"Three sons, two daughters. The direwolf is the sigil of your \nHouse. Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord.\" \nBran saw his father's face change, saw the other men exchange glances. He loved Jon with all his heart \nat that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count had come right \nonly because Jon had omitted himself. He had included the girls, \nincluded even Rickon, the baby, but not the bastard who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom \ndecreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own. \nTheir father understood as well. \"You want no pup for yourself, Jon?\" he asked softly. \n\"The direwolf graces the banners of House Stark,\" Jon pointed out. \"I am no Stark, Father.\" \nTheir lord father regarded Jon thoughtfully. Robb rushed into the silence he left. \"I will nurse him myself, \nFather,\" he promised. \"I will soak a towel with warm milk, and give him suck from that.\" \n\"Me too!\" Bran echoed. \nThe lord weighed his sons long and carefully with his eyes. \"Easy to say, and harder to do. I will not \nhave you wasting the servants' time with this. If you want these pups, you will feed them yourselves. Is \nthat understood?\" \nBran nodded eagerly. The pup squirmed in his grasp, licked at his face with a warm tongue. \n\"You must train them as well,\" their father said. \"You must train them. The kennelmaster will have nothing \nto do with these monsters, I promise you that. And the gods help you if you neglect them, or brutalize \nthem, or train them badly. These are not dogs to beg for treats and slink off at a kick. A direwolf will rip \nPage 13\n\na man's arm off his shoulder as easily as a dog will kill a rat. Are you sure you want this?\" \n\"Yes, Father,\" Bran said. \n\"Yes,\" Robb agreed. \n\"The pups may die anyway, despite all you do.\" \n\"They won't die,\" Robb said. \"We won't let them die.\" \n\"Keep them, then. Jory, Desmond, gather up the other pups. It's time we were back to Winterfell.\" \nIt was not until they were mounted and on their way that Bran allowed himself to taste the sweet air of \nvictory. By then, his pup was snuggled inside his leathers, warm against him, safe for the long ride home. \nBran was wondering what to name him. \nHalfway across the bridge, Jon pulled up suddenly. \n\"What is it, Jon?\" their lord father asked. \n\"Can't you hear it?\" \nBran could hear the wind in the trees, the clatter of their hooves on the ironwood planks, the whimpering \nof his hungry pup, but Jon was listening to something else. \n\"There,\" Jon said. He swung his horse around and galloped back across the bridge. They watched him \ndismount where the direwolf lay \ndead in the snow, watched him kneel. A moment later he was riding back to them, smiling. \n\"He must have crawled away from the others,\" Jon said. \n\"Or been driven away,\" their father said, looking at the sixth pup. His fur was white, where the rest of the \nlitter was grey. His eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning. Bran \nthought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind. \n\"An albino,\" Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement. \"This one will die even faster than the others.\" \nJon Snow gave his father's ward a long, chilling look. \"I think not, Greyjoy,\" he said. \"This one belongs \nto me.\" \nCATELYN \nCatelyn had never liked this godswood. \nShe had been born a Tully, at Riverrun far to the south, on the Red Fork of the Trident. The godswood \nthere was a garden, bright and airy, where tall redwoods spread dappled shadows across tinkling \nstreams, birds sang from hidden nests, and the air was spicy with the scent of flowers. \nPage 14\n\nThe gods of Winterfell kept a different sort of wood. It was a dark, primal place, three acres of old \nforest untouched for ten thousand years as the gloomy castle rose around it. It smelled of moist earth and \ndecay. No redwoods grew here. This was a wood of stubborn sentinel trees armored in grey-green \nneedles, of mighty oaks, of ironwoods as old as the realm itself. Here thick black trunks crowded close \ntogether while twisted branches wove a dense canopy overhead and misshappen roots wrestled beneath \nthe soil. This was a place of deep silence and brooding shadows, and the gods who lived here had no \nnames. \nBut she knew she would find her husband here tonight. Whenever he took a man's life, afterward he \nwould seek the quiet of the godswood. \nCatelyn had been anointed with the seven oils and named in the rainbow of light that filled the sept of \nRiverrun. She was of the Faith, like her father and grandfather and his father before him. Her gods had \nnames, and their faces were as familiar as the faces of her parents. \nWorship was a septon with a censer, the smell of incense, a seven-sided crystal alive with light, voices \nraised in song. The Tullys kept a godswood, as all the great houses did, but it was only a place to walk \nor read or lie in the sun. Worship was for the sept. \nFor her sake, Ned had built a small sept where she might sing to the seven faces of god, but the blood of \nthe First Men still flowed in the veins of the Starks, and his own gods were the old ones, the nameless, \nfaceless gods of the greenwood they shared with the vanished children of the forest. \nAt the center of the grove an ancient weirwood brooded over a small pool where the waters were black \nand cold. \"The heart tree,\" Ned called it. The weirwood's bark was white as bone, its leaves dark red, \nlike a thousand bloodstained hands. A face had been carved in the trunk of the great tree, its features \nlong and melancholy, the deep-cut eyes red with dried sap and strangely watchful. They were old, those \neyes; older than Winterfell itself. They had seen Brandon the Builder set the first stone, if the tales were \ntrue; they had watched the castle's granite walls rise around them. It was said that the children of the \nforest had carved the faces in the trees during the dawn centuries before the coming of the First Men \nacross the narrow sea. \nIn the south the last weirwoods had been cut down or burned out a thousand years ago, except on the \nIsle of Faces where the green men kept their silent watch. Up here it was different. Here every castle had \nits godswood, and every godswood had its heart tree, and every heart tree its face. \nCatelyn found her husband beneath the weirwood, seated on a moss-covered stone. The greatsword \nIce was across his lap, and he was cleaning the blade in those waters black as night. A thousand years of \nhumus lay thick upon the godswood floor, swallowing the sound of her feet, but the red eyes of the \nweirwood seemed to follow her as she came. \"Ned,\" she called softly. \nHe lifted his head to look at her. \"Catelyn,\" he said. His voice was distant and formal. \"Where are the \nchildren?\" \nHe would always ask her that. \"In the kitchen, arguing about names for the wolf pups.\" She spread her \ncloak on the forest floor and sat beside the pool, her back to the weirwood. She could feel the eyes \nwatching her, but she did her best to ignore them. \"Arya is already in love, and Sansa is charmed and \ngracious, but Rickon is not quite sure.\" \n\"Is he afraid?\" Ned asked. \nPage 15\n\n\"A little,\" she admitted. \"He is only three.\" \nNed frowned. \"He must learn to face his fears. He will not be three forever. And winter is coming.\" \n\"Yes,\" Catelyn agreed. The words gave her a chill, as they always did. The Stark words. Every noble \nhouse had its words. Family mottoes, touchstones, prayers of sorts, they boasted of honor and glory, \npromised loyalty and truth, swore faith and courage. All but the Starks. Winter is coming, said the Stark \nwords. Not for the first time, she reflected on what a strange people these northerners; were. \n\"The man died well, I'll give him that,\" Ned said. He had a swatch of oiled leather in one hand. He ran it \nlightly up the greatsword as he spoke, polishing the metal to a dark glow. \"I was glad for Bran's sake. \nYou would have been proud of Bran.\" \n\"I am always proud of Bran,\" Catelyn replied, watching the sword as he stroked it. She could see the \nrippling deep within the steel, where the metal had been folded back on itself a hundred times in the \nforging. Catelyn had no love for swords, but she could not deny that Ice had its own beauty. It had been \nforged in Valyria, before the Doom had come to the old Freehold, when the ironsmiths had worked their \nmetal with spells as well as hammers. Four hundred years old it was, and as sharp as the day it was \nforged. The name it bore was older still, a legacy from the age of heroes, when the Starks were Kings in \nthe North. \n\"He was the fourth this year,\" Ned said grimly. \"The poor man was half-mad. Something had put a fear \nin him so deep that my words could not reach him.\" He sighed. \"Ben writes that the strength of the \nNight's Watch is down below a thousand. It's not only desertions. They are losing men on rangings as \nwell.\" \n\"Is it the wildlings?\" she asked. \n\"Who else?\" Ned lifted Ice, looked down the cool steel length of it. \"And it will only grow worse. The \nday may come when I will have no choice but to call the banners and ride north to deal with this \nKingbeyond-the-Wall for good and all.\" \n\"Beyond the Wall?\" The thought made Catelyn shudder. \nNed saw the dread on her face. \"Mance Rayder is nothing for us to fear.\" \n\"There are darker things beyond the Wall.\" She glanced behind her at the heart tree, the pale bark and \nred eyes, watching, listening, thinking its long slow thoughts. \nHis smile was gentle. \"You listen to too many of Old Nan's stories. The Others are as dead as the \nchildren of the forest, gone eight thousand years. Maester Luwin will tell you they never lived at all. No \nliving man has ever seen one.\" \n\"Until this morning, no living man had ever seen a direwolf either,\" Catelyn reminded him. \n\"I ought to know better than to argue with a Tully,\" he said with a rueful smile. He slid Ice back into its \nsheath. \"You did not come here to tell me crib tales. I know how little you like this place. What is it, my \nlady?\" \nCatelyn took her husband's hand. \"There was grievous news today, my lord. I did not wish to trouble \nyou until you had cleansed yourself.\" There was no way to soften the blow, so she told him straight. \"I am \nPage 16\n\nso sorry, my love. Jon Arryn is dead.\" \nHis eyes found hers, and she could see how hard it took him, as she had known it would. In his youth, \nNed had fostered at the Eyrie, and the childless Lord Arryn had become a second father to him and his \nfellow ward, Robert Baratheon. When the Mad King Aerys 11 Targaryen had demanded their heads, \nthe Lord of the Eyrie had raised his moon-and-falcon banners in revolt rather than give up those he had \npledged to protect. \nAnd one day fifteen years ago, this second father had become a brother as well, as he and Ned stood \ntogether in the sept at Riverrun to wed two sisters, the daughters of Lord Hoster Tully. \n\"Jon . . .\" he said. \"Is this news certain?\" \n\"It was the king's seal, and the letter is in Robert's own hand. I saved it for you. He said Lord Arryn was \ntaken quickly. Even Maester Pycelle was helpless, but he brought the milk of the poppy, so Jon did not \nlinger long in pain.\" \n\"That is some small mercy, I suppose,\" he said. She could see the grief on his face, but even then he \nthought first of her. \"Your sister,\" he said. \"And Jon's boy. What word of them?\" \n\"The message said only that they were well, and had returned to the Eyrie,\" Catelyn said. \"I wish they \nhad gone to Riverrun instead. The Eyrie is high and lonely, and it was ever her husband's place, not hers. \nLord Jon's memory will haunt each stone. I know my sister. She needs the comfort of family and friends \naround her.\" \n\"Your uncle waits in the Vale, does he not? Jon named him Knight of the Gate, I'd heard.\" \nCatelyn nodded. \"Brynden will do what he can for her, and for the boy. That is some comfort, but still . . \n.\" \n\"Go to her,\" Ned urged. \"Take the children. Fill her halls with noise and shouts and laughter. That boy of \nhers needs other children about him, and Lysa should not be alone in her grief.\" \n\"Would that I could,\" Catelyn said. \"The letter had other tidings. The king is riding to Winterfell to seek \nyou out.\" \nIt took Ned a moment to comprehend her words, but when the \nunderstanding came, the darkness left his eyes. \"Robert is coming here?\" When she nodded, a smile \nbroke across his face. \nCatelyn wished she could share his joy. But she had heard the talk in the yards; a direwolf dead in the \nsnow, a broken antler in its throat. Dread coiled within her like a snake, but she forced herself to smile at \nthis man she loved, this man who put no faith in signs. \"I knew that would please you,\" she said. \"We \nshould send word to your brother on the Wall.\" \n\"Yes, of course,\" he agreed. \"Ben will want to be here. I shall tell Maester Luwin to send his swiftest \nbird.\" Ned rose and pulled her to her feet. \"Damnation, how many years has it been? And he gives us no \nmore notice than this? How many in his party, did the message say?\" \n\"I should think a hundred knights, at the least, with all their retainers, and half again as many freeriders. \nPage 17\n\nCersei and the children travel with them.\" \n\"Robert will keep an easy pace for their sakes,\" he said. \"It is just as well. That will give us more time to \nprepare.\" \n\"The queen's brothers are also in the party,\" she told him. \nNed grimaced at that. There was small love between him and the queen's family, Catelyn knew. The \nLannisters of Casterly Rock had come late to Robert's cause, when victory was all but certain, and he \nhad never forgiven them. \"Well, if the price for Robert's company is an infestation of Lannisters, so be it. \nIt sounds as though Robert is bringing half his court.\" \n\"Where the king goes, the realm follows,\" she said. \n\"It will be good to see the children. The youngest was still sucking at the Lannister woman's teat the last \ntime I saw him. He must be, what, five by now?\" \n\"Prince Tornmen is seven,\" she told him. \"The same age as Bran. Please, Ned, guard your tongue. The \nLannister woman is our queen, and her pride is said to grow with every passing year.\" \nNed squeezed her hand. \"There must be a feast, of course, with singers, and Robert will want to hunt. I \nshall send Jory south with an honor guard to meet them on the kingsroad and escort them back. Gods, \nhow are we going to feed them all? On his way already, you said? Damn the man. Damn his royal hide.\" \nDAENERYS \nHer brother held the gown up for her inspection. \"This is beauty. Touch it. Go on. Caress the fabric.\" \nDany touched it. The cloth was so smooth that it seemed to run through her fingers like water. She could \nnot remember ever wearing anything so soft. It frightened her. She pulled her hand away. \"Is it really \nmine?\" \n\"A gift from the Magister Illyrio,\" Viserys said, smiling. Her brother was in a high mood tonight. \"The \ncolor will bring out the violet in your eyes. And you shall have gold as well, and jewels of all sorts. Illyrio \nhas promised. Tonight you must look like a princess.\" \nA princess, Dany thought. She had forgotten what that was like. Perhaps she had never really known. \n\"Why does he give us so much?\" she asked. \"What does he want from us?\" For nigh on half a year, they \nhad lived in the magister's house, eating his food, pampered by his servants. Dany was thirteen, old \nenough to know that such gifts seldom come without their price, here in the free city of Pentos. \n\"Illyrio is no fool,\" Viserys said. He was a gaunt young man with nervous hands and a feverish look in his \npale lilac eyes. \"The magister knows that I will not forget my friends when I come into my throne.\" \nDany said nothing. Magister Illyrio was a dealer in spices, gemstones, dragonbone, and other, less \nsavory things. He had friends in all of the Nine Free Cities, it was said, and even beyond, in Vaes \nDothrak \nand the fabled lands beside the Jade Sea. It was also said that he'd never had a friend he wouldn't \nPage 18\n\ncheerfully sell for the right price. Dany listened to the talk in the streets, and she heard these things, but \nshe knew better than to question her brother when he wove his webs of dream. His anger was a terrible \nthing when roused. Viserys called it \"waking the dragon.\" \nHer brother hung the gown beside the door. \"Illyrio will send the slaves to bathe you. Be sure you wash \noff the stink of the stables. Khal Drogo has a thousand horses, tonight he looks for a different sort of \nmount.\" He studied her critically. \"You still slouch. Straighten yourself\" He pushed back her shoulders \nwith his hands. \"Let them see that you have a woman's shape now.\" His fingers brushed lightly over her \nbudding breasts and tightened on a nipple. \"You will not fail me tonight. If you do, it will go hard for you. \nYou don't want to wake the dragon, do you?\" His fingers twisted her, the pinch cruelly hard through the \nrough fabric of her tunic. \"Do you?\" he repeated. \n\"No,\" Dany said meekly. \nHer brother smiled. \"Good.\" He touched her hair, almost with affection. \"When they write the history of \nmy reign, sweet sister, they will say that it began tonight.\" \nWhen he was gone, Dany went to her window and looked out wistfully on the waters of the bay. The \nsquare brick towers of Pentos were black silhouettes outlined against the setting sun. Dany could hear the \nsinging of the red priests as they lit their night fires and the shouts of ragged children playing games \nbeyond the walls of the estate. For a moment she wished she could be out there with them, barefoot and \nbreathless and dressed in tatters, with no past and no future and no feast to attend at Khal Drogo's \nmanse. \nSomewhere beyond the sunset, across the narrow sea, lay a land of green hills and flowered plains and \ngreat rushing rivers, where towers of dark stone rose amidst magnificent blue-grey mountains, and \narmored knights rode to battle beneath the banners of their lords. The Dothraki called that land Rhaesh \nAndahli, the land of the Andals. In the Free Cities, they talked of Westeros and the Sunset Kingdoms. \nHer brother had a simpler name. \"Our land,\" he called it. The words were like a prayer with him. If he \nsaid them enough, the gods were sure to hear. \"Ours by blood right, taken from us by treachery, but ours \nstill, ours forever. You do not steal from the dragon, oh, no. The dragon remembers.\" \nAnd perhaps the dragon did remember, but Dany could not. She had never seen this land her brother \nsaid was theirs, this realm beyond the narrow sea. These places he talked of, Casterly Rock and the \nEyrie, Highgarden and the Vale of Arryn, Dorne and the Isle of Faces, they were just words to her. \nViserys had been a boy of eight when they fled King's Landing to escape the advancing armies of the \nUsurper, but Daenerys had been only a quickening in their mother's womb. \nYet sometimes Dany would picture the way it had been, so often had her brother told her the stories. \nThe midnight flight to Dragonstone, moonlight shimmering on the ship's black sails. Her brother Rhaegar \nbattling the Usurper in the bloody waters of the Trident and dying for the woman he loved. The sack of \nKing's Landing by the ones Viserys called the Usurper's dogs, the lords Lannister and Stark. Princess \nElia of Dorne pleading for mercy as Rhaegar's heir was ripped from her breast and murdered before her \neyes. The polished skulls of the last dragons staring down sightlessly from the walls of the throne room \nwhile the Kingslayer opened Father's throat with a golden sword. \nShe had been born on Dragonstone nine moons after their flight, while a raging summer storm threatened \nto rip the island fastness apart. They said that storm was terrible. The Targaryen fleet was smashed while \nit lay at anchor, and huge stone blocks were ripped from the parapets and sent hurtling into the wild \nwaters of the narrow sea. Her mother had died birthing her, and for that her brother Viserys had never \nPage 19\n\nforgiven her. \nShe did not remember Dragonstone either. They had run again, just before the Usurper's brother set sail \nwith his new-built fleet. By then only Dragonstone itself, the ancient seat of their House, had remained of \nthe Seven Kingdoms that had once been theirs. It would not remain for long. The garrison had been \nprepared to sell them to the Usurper, but one night Ser Willem Darry and four loyal men had broken into \nthe nursery and stolen them both, along with her wet nurse, and set sail under cover of darkness for the \nsafety of the Braavosian coast. \nShe remembered Ser Willem dimly, a great grey bear of a man, halfblind, roaring and bellowing orders \nfrom his sickbed. The servants had lived in terror of him, but he had always been kind to Dany. He called \nher \"Little Princess\" and sometimes \"My Lady,\" and his hands were soft as old leather. He never left his \nbed, though, and the smell of sickness clung to him day and night, a hot, moist, sickly sweet odor. That \nwas when they lived in Braavos, in the big house with the red door. Dany had her own room there, with a \nlemon tree outside her window. After Ser Willem had died, the servants had stolen what little money they \nhad left, and soon after they had been put out of the big house. Dany had cried when the red door closed \nbehind them forever. \nThey had wandered since then, from Braavos to Myr, from Myr to Tyrosh, and on to Qohor and \nVolantis and Lys, never staying long in \nany one place. Her brother would not allow it. The Usurper's hired knives were close behind them, he \ninsisted, though Dany had never seen one. \nAt first the magisters and archons and merchant princes were pleased to welcome the last Targaryens to \ntheir homes and tables, but as the years passed and the Usurper continued to sit upon the Iron Throne, \ndoors closed and their lives grew meaner. Years past they had been forced to sell their last few treasures, \nand now even the coin they had gotten from Mother's crown had gone. In the alleys and wine sinks of \nPentos, they called her brother \"the beggar king.\" Dany did not want to know what they called her. \n\"We will have it all back someday, sweet sister,\" he would promise her. Sometimes his hands shook \nwhen he talked about it. \"The jewels and the silks, Dragonstone and King's Landing, the Iron Throne and \nthe Seven Kingdoms, all they have taken from us, we will have it back.\" Viserys lived for that day. All \nthat Daenerys wanted back was the big house with the red door, the lemon tree outside her window, the \nchildhood she had never known. \nThere came a soft knock on her door. \"Come,\" Dany said, turning away from the window. Illyrio's \nservants entered, bowed, and set about their business. They were slaves, a gift from one of the magister's \nmany Dothraki friends. There was no slavery in the free city of Pentos. Nonetheless, they were slaves. \nThe old woman, small and grey as a mouse, never said a word, but the girl made up for it. She was \nIllyrio's favorite, a fair-haired, blue-eyed wench of sixteen who chattered constantly as she worked. \nThey filled her bath with hot water brought up from the kitchen and scented it with fragrant oils. The girl \npulled the rough cotton tunic over Dany's head and helped her into the tub. The water was scalding hot, \nbut Daenerys did not flinch or cry out. She liked the heat. It made her feel clean. Besides, her brother \nhad often told her that it was never too \nhot for a Targaryen. \"Ours is the house of the dragon,\" he would say. \"The fire is in our blood.\" \nThe old woman washed her long, silver-pale hair and gently combed out the snags, all in silence. The girl \nscrubbed her back and her feet and told her how lucky she was. \"Drogo is so rich that even his slaves \nPage 20\n\nwear golden collars. A hundred thousand men ride in his khalasar, and \nhis palace in Vaes Dothrak has two hundred rooms and doors of solid silver.\" There was more like that, \nso much more, what a handsome \nman the khal was, so tall and fierce, fearless in battle, the best rider ever to mount a horse, a demon \narcher. Daenerys said nothing. She had always assumed that she would wed Viserys when she came of \nage. \nFor centuries the Targaryens had married brother to sister, since Aegon the Conqueror had taken his \nsisters to bride. The line must be kept pure, Viserys had told her a thousand times; theirs was the \nkingsblood, the golden blood of old Valyria, the blood of the dragon. Dragons did not mate with the \nbeasts of the field, and Targaryens did not mingle their blood with that of lesser men. Yet now Viserys \nschemed to sell her to a stranger, a barbarian. \nWhen she was clean, the slaves helped her from the water and toweled her dry. The girl brushed her hair \nuntil it shone like molten silver, while the old woman anointed her with the spiceflower perfume of the \nDothraki plains, a dab on each wrist, behind her ears, on the tips of her breasts, and one last one, cool \non her lips, down there between her legs. They dressed her in the wisps that Magister Illyrio had sent up, \nand then the gown, a deep plum silk to bring out the violet in her eyes. The girl slid the gilded sandals \nonto her feet, while the old woman fixed the tiara in her hair, and slid golden bracelets crusted with \namethysts around her wrists. Last of all came the collar, a heavy golden tore emblazoned with ancient \nValyrian glyphs. \n\"Now you look all a princess,\" the girl said breathlessly when they were done. Dany glanced at her \nimage in the silvered looking glass that Illyrio had so thoughtfully provided. A princess, she thought, but \nshe remembered what the girl had said, how Khal Drogo was so rich even his slaves wore golden collars. \nShe felt a sudden chill, and gooseflesh pimpled her bare arms. \nHer brother was waiting in the cool of the entry hall, seated on the edge of the pool, his hand trailing in \nthe water. He rose when she appeared and looked her over critically. \"Stand there,\" he told her. \"Turn \naround. Yes. Good. You look . . .\" \n\"Regal,\" Magister Illyrio said, stepping through an archway. He moved with surprising delicacy for such \na massive man. Beneath loose garments of flame-colored silk, rolls of fat jiggled as he walked. \nGemstones glittered on every finger, and his man had oiled his forked yellow beard until it shone like real \ngold. \"May the Lord of Light shower you with blessings on this most fortunate day, Princess Daenerys,\" \nthe magister said as he took her hand. He bowed his head, showing a thin glimpse of crooked yellow \nteeth through the gold of his beard. \"She is a vision, Your Grace, a vision,\" he told her brother. \"Drogo \nwill be enraptured.\" \n\"She's too skinny,\" Viserys said. His hair, the same silver-blond as hers, had been pulled back tightly \nbehind his head and fastened with a dragonbone brooch. It was a severe look that emphasized the hard, \ngaunt lines of his face. He rested his hand on the hilt of the sword that \nIllyrio had lent him, and said, \"Are you sure that Khal Drogo likes his women this young?\" \n\"She has had her blood. She is old enough for the khal, \" Illyrio told him, not for the first time. \"Look at \nher. That silvergold hair, those purple eyes . . . she is the blood of old Valyria, no doubt, no doubt . . . \nand highborn, daughter of the old king, sister to the new, she cannot fail to entrance our Drogo.\" When \nhe released her hand, Daenerys found herself trembling. \nPage 21\n\n\"I suppose,\" her brother said doubtfully. \"The savages have queer tastes. Boys, horses, sheep . . .\" \n\"Best not suggest this to Khal Drogo,\" Illyrio said. \nAnger flashed in her brother's lilac eyes. \"Do you take me for a fool?\" \nThe magister bowed slightly. \"I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My \napologies if I have given offense.\" He turned away and clapped his hands for his bearers. \nThe streets of Pentos were pitch-dark when they set out in Illyrio's elaborately carved palanquin. Two \nservants went ahead to light their way, carrying ornate oil lanterns with panes of pale blue glass, while a \ndozen strong men hoisted the poles to their shoulders. It was warm and close inside behind the curtains. \nDany could smell the stench of Illyrio's pallid flesh through his heavy perfumes. \nHer brother, sprawled out on his pillows beside her, never noticed. His mind was away across the \nnarrow sea. \"We won't need his whole khalasar, \" Viserys said. His fingers toyed with the hilt of his \nborrowed blade, though Dany knew he had never used a sword in earnest. \"Ten thousand, that would be \nenough, I could sweep the Seven Kingdoms with ten thousand Dothraki screamers. The realm will rise \nfor its rightful king. Tyrell, Redwyne, Darry, Greyjoy, they have no more love for the Usurper than I do. \nThe Dornishmen burn to avenge Elia and her children. And the smallfolk will be with us. They cry out for \ntheir king.\" He looked at Illyrio anxiously. \"They do, don't they?\" \n\"They are your people, and they love you well,\" Magister Illyrio said amiably. \"In holdfasts all across the \nrealm, men lift secret toasts to your health while women sew dragon banners and hide them against the \nday of your return from across the water.\" He gave a massive shrug. \"Or so my agents tell me.\" \nDany had no agents, no way of knowing what anyone was doing or thinking across the narrow sea, but \nshe mistrusted Illyrio's sweet words as she mistrusted everything about Illyrio. Her brother was nodding \neagerly, however. \"I shall kill the Usurper myself,\" he promised, who \nhad never killed anyone, \"as he killed my brother Rhaegar. And Lannister too, the Kingslayer, for what \nhe did to my father.\" \n\"That would be most fitting,\" Magister Illyrio said. Dany saw the smallest hint of a smile playing around \nhis full lips, but her brother did not notice. Nodding, he pushed back a curtain and stared off into the \nnight, and Dany knew he was fighting the Battle of the Trident once again. \nThe nine-towered manse of Khal Drogo sat beside the waters of the bay, its high brick walls overgrown \nwith pale ivy. It had been given to the khal by the magisters of Pentos, Illyrio told them. The Free Cities \nwere always generous with the horselords. \"It is not that we fear these barbarians,\" Illyrio would explain \nwith a smile. \"The Lord of Light would hold our city walls against a million Dothraki, or so the red priests \npromise . . . yet why take chances, when their friendship comes so cheap?\" \nTheir palanquin was stopped at the gate, the curtains pulled roughly back by one of the house guards. \nHe had the copper skin and dark almond eyes of a Dothraki, but his face was hairless and he wore the \nspiked bronze cap of the Unsullied. He looked them over coldly. Magister Illyrio growled something to \nhim in the rough Dothraki tongue; the guardsman replied in the same voice and waved them through the \ngates. \nDany noticed that her brother's hand was clenched tightly around the hilt of his borrowed sword. He \nPage 22\n\nlooked almost as frightened as she felt. \"Insolent eunuch,\" Viserys muttered as the palanquin lurched up \ntoward the manse. \nMagister Illyrio's words were honey. \"Many important men will be at the feast tonight. Such men have \nenemies. The khal must protect his guests, yourself chief among them, Your Grace. No doubt the \nUsurper would pay well for your head.\" \n\"Oh, yes,\" Viserys said darkly. \"He has tried, Illyrio, I promise you that. His hired knives follow us \neverywhere. I am the last dragon, and he will not sleep easy while I live.\" \nThe palanquin slowed and stopped. The curtains were thrown back, and a slave offered a hand to help \nDaenerys out. His collar, she noted, was ordinary bronze. Her brother followed, one hand still clenched \nhard around his sword hilt. It took two strong men to get Magister Illyrio back on his feet. \nInside the manse, the air was heavy with the scent of spices, pinchfire and sweet lemon and cinnamon. \nThey were escorted across the entry hall, where a mosaic of colored glass depicted the Doom of Valyria. \nOil burned in black iron lanterns all along the walls. Beneath \nan arch of twining stone leaves, a eunuch sang their coming. \"Viserys of the House Targaryen, the Third \nof his Name,\" he called in a high, sweet voice, \"King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, \nLord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. His sister, Daenerys Stormborn, Princess of \nDragonstone. His honorable host, Illyrio Mopatis, Magister of the Free City of Pentos.\" \nThey stepped past the eunuch into a pillared courtyard overgrown in pale ivy. Moonlight painted the \nleaves in shades of bone and silver as the guests drifted among them. Many were Dothraki horselords, \nbig men with red-brown skin, their drooping mustachios bound in metal rings, their black hair oiled and \nbraided and hung with bells. Yet among them moved bravos and sellswords from Pentos and Myr and \nTyrosh, a red priest even fatter than Illyrio, hairy men from the Port of Ibben, and lords from the Summer \nIsles with skin as black as ebony. Daenerys looked at them all in wonder . . . and realized, with a sudden \nstart of fear, that she was the only woman there. \nIllyrio whispered to them. \"Those three are Drogo's bloodriders, there,\" he said. \"By the pillar is Khal \nMoro, with his son Rhogoro. The man with the green beard is brother to the Archon of Tyrosh, and the \nman behind him is Ser Jorah Mormont.\" \nThe last name caught Daenerys. \"A knight?\" \n\"No less.\" Illyrio smiled through his beard. \"Anointed with the seven oils by the High Septon himself.\" \n\"What is he doing here?\" she blurted. \n\"The Usurper wanted his head,\" Illyrio told them. \"Some trifling affront. He sold some poachers to a \nTyroshi slaver instead of giving them to the Night's Watch. Absurd law. A man should be able to do as \nhe likes with his own chattel.\" \n\"I shall wish to speak with Ser Jorah before the night is done,\" her brother said. Dany found herself \nlooking at the knight curiously. He was an older man, past forty and balding, but still strong and fit. \nInstead of silks and cottons, he wore wool and leather. His tunic was a dark green, embroidered with the \nlikeness of a black bear standing on two legs. \nShe was still looking at this strange man from the homeland she had never known when Magister Illyrio \nPage 23\n\nplaced a moist hand on her bare shoulder. \"Over there, sweet princess,\" he whispered, \"there is the khal \nhimself.\" \nDany wanted to run and hide, but her brother was looking at her, and if she displeased him she knew \nshe would wake the dragon. Anxiously, she turned and looked at the man Viserys hoped would ask to \nwed her before the night was done. \nThe slave girl had not been far wrong, she thought. Khal Drogo was a head taller than the tallest man in \nthe room, yet somehow light on his feet, as graceful as the panther in Illyrio's menagerie. He was younger \nthan she'd thought, no more than thirty. His skin was the color of polished copper, his thick mustachios \nbound with gold and bronze rings. \n\"I must go and make my submissions,\" Magister Illyrio said. \"Wait here. I shall bring him to you.\" \nHer brother took her by the arm as Illyrio waddled over to the khal, his fingers squeezing so hard that \nthey hurt. \"Do you see his braid, sweet sister?\" \nDrogo's braid was black as midnight and heavy with scented oil, hung with tiny bells that rang softly as \nhe moved. It swung well past his belt, below even his buttocks, the end of it brushing against the back of \nhis thighs. \n\"You see how long it is?\" Viserys said. \"When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braids \nin disgrace, so the world will know their shame. Khal Drogo has never lost a fight. He is Aegon the \nDragonlord come again, and you will be his queen.\" \nDany looked at Khal Drogo. His face was hard and cruel, his eyes as cold and dark as onyx. Her \nbrother hurt her sometimes, when she woke the dragon, but he did not frighten her the way this man \nfrightened her. \"I don't want to be his queen,\" she heard herself say in a small, thin voice. \"Please, please, \nViserys, I don't want to, I want to go home.\" \n\"Home?\" He kept his voice low, but she could hear the fury in his tone. \"How are we to go home, sweet \nsister? They took our home from us!\" He drew her into the shadows, out of sight, his fingers digging into \nher skin. \"How are we to go home?\" he repeated, meaning King's Landing, and Dragonstone, and all the \nrealm they had lost. \nDany had only meant their rooms in Illyrio's estate, no true home surely, though all they had, but her \nbrother did not want to hear that. There was no home there for him. Even the big house with the red door \nhad not been home for him. His fingers dug hard into her arm, demanding an answer. \"I don't know she \nsaid at last, her voice breaking. Tears welled in her eyes. \n\"I do,\" he said sharply. \"We go home with an army, sweet sister. With Khal Drogo's army, that is how \nwe go home. And if you must wed him and bed him for that, you will.\" He smiled at her. \"I'd let his whole \nkhalasar fuck you if need be, sweet sister, all forty thousand men, and their horses too if that was what it \ntook to get my army. Be grateful it is \nonly Drogo. In time you may even learn to like him. Now dry your eyes. Illyrio is bringing him over, and \nhe will not see you crying.\" \nDany turned and saw that it was true. Magister Illyrio, all smiles and bows, was escorting Khal Drogo \nover to where they stood. She brushed away unfallen tears with the back of her hand. \nPage 24\n\n\"Smile,\" Viserys whispered nervously, his hand failing to the hilt of his sword. \"And stand up straight. Let \nhim see that you have breasts. Gods know, you have little enough as is.\" \nDaenerys smiled, and stood up straight. \nEDDARD \nThe visitors poured through the castle gates in a river of gold and silver and polished steel, three hundred \nstrong, a pride of bannermen and knights, of sworn swords and freeriders. Over their heads a dozen \ngolden banners whipped back and forth in the northern wind, emblazoned with the crowned stag of \nBaratheon. \nNed knew many of the riders. There came Ser Jaime Lannister with hair as bright as beaten gold, and \nthere Sandor Clegane with his terrible burned face. The tall boy beside him could only be the crown \nprince, and that stunted little man behind them was surely the Imp, Tyrion Lannister. \nYet the huge man at the head of the column, flanked by two knights in the snow-white cloaks of the \nKingsguard, seemed almost a stranger to Ned . . . until he vaulted off the back of his warhorse with a \nfamiliar roar, and crushed him in a bone-crunching hug. \"Ned! Ah, but it is good to see that frozen face of \nyours.\" The king looked him over top to bottom, and laughed. \"You have not changed at all.\" \nWould that Ned had been able to say the same. Fifteen years past, when they had ridden forth to win a \nthrone, the Lord of Storm's End had been clean-shaven, clear-eyed, and muscled like a maiden's fantasy. \nSix and a half feet tall, he towered over lesser men, and when he donned his armor and the great antlered \nhelmet of his House, he became a veritable giant. He'd had a giant's strength too, his weapon \nof choice a spiked iron warhammer that Ned could scarcely lift. In those days, the smell of leather and \nblood had clung to him like perfume. \nNow it was perfume that clung to him like perfume, and he had a girth to match his height. Ned had last \nseen the king nine years before during Balon Greyjoy's rebellion, when the stag and the direwolf had \njoined to end the pretensions of the self-proclaimed King of the Iron Islands. Since the night they had \nstood side by side in Greyjoy's fallen stronghold, where Robert had accepted the rebel lord's surrender \nand Ned had taken his son Theon as hostage and ward, the king had gained at least eight stone. A beard \nas coarse and black as iron wire covered his jaw to hide his double chin and the sag of the royal jowls, \nbut nothing could hide his stomach or the dark circles under his eyes. \nYet Robert was Ned's king now, and not just a friend, so he said only, \"Your Grace. Winterfell is \nyours.\" \nBy then the others were dismounting as well, and grooms were coming forward for their mounts. \nRobert's queen, Cersei Lannister, entered on foot with her younger children. The wheelhouse in which \nthey had ridden, a huge double-decked carriage of oiled oak and gilded metal pulled by forty heavy draft \nhorses, was too wide to pass through the castle gate. Ned knelt in the snow to kiss the queen's ring, \nwhile Robert embraced Catelyn like a long-lost sister. Then the children had been brought forward, \nintroduced, and approved of by both sides. \nNo sooner had those formalities of greeting been completed than the king had said to his host, \"Take me \ndown to your crypt, Eddard. I would pay my respects.\" \nPage 25\n\nNed loved him for that, for remembering her still after all these years. He called for a lantern. No other \nwords were needed. The queen had begun to protest. They had been riding since dawn, everyone was \ntired and cold, surely they should refresh themselves first. The dead would wait. She had said no more \nthan that; Robert had looked at her, and her twin brother Jaime had taken her quietly by the arm, and she \nhad said no more. \nThey went down to the crypt together, Ned and this king he scarcely recognized. The winding stone \nsteps were narrow. Ned went first with the lantern. \"I was starting to think we would never reach \nWinterfell,\" Robert complained as they descended. \"In the south, the way they talk about my Seven \nKingdoms, a man forgets that your part is as big as the other six combined.\" \n\"I trust you enjoyed the journey, Your Grace?\" \nRobert snorted. \"Bogs and forests and fields, and scarcely a decent \ninn north of the Neck. I've never seen such a vast emptiness. Where are all yourpeople?\" \n\"Likely they were too shy to come out,\" Ned jested. He could feel the chill coming up the stairs, a cold \nbreath from deep within the earth. \"Kings are a rare sight in the north.\" \nRobert snorted. \"More likely they were hiding under the snow. Snow, Ned!\" The king put one hand on \nthe wall to steady himself as they descended. \n\"Late summer snows are common enough,\" Ned said. \"I hope they did not trouble you. They are usually \nmild.\" \n\"The Others take your mild snows,\" Robert swore. \"What will this place be like in winter? I shudder to \nthink.\" \n\"The winters are hard,\" Ned admitted. \"But the Starks will endure. We always have.\" \n\"You need to come south,\" Robert told him. \"You need a taste of summer before it flees. In Highgarden \nthere are fields of golden roses that stretch away as far as the eye can see. The fruits are so ripe they \nexplode in your mouth-melons, peaches, fireplums, you've never tasted such sweetness. You'll see, I \nbrought you some. Even at Storm's End, with that good wind off the bay, the days are so hot you can \nbarely move. And you ought to see the towns, Ned! Flowers everywhere, the markets bursting with \nfood, the surnmerwines so cheap and so good that you can get drunk just breathing the air. Everyone is \nfat and drunk and rich.\" He laughed and slapped his own ample stomach a thump. \"And the girls, Ned!\" \nhe exclaimed, his eyes sparkling. \"I swear, women lose all modesty in the heat. They swim naked in the \nriver, right beneath the castle. Even in the streets, it's too damn hot for wool or fur, so they go around in \nthese short gowns, silk if they have the silver and cotton if not, but it's all the same when they start \nsweating and the cloth sticks to their skin, they might as well be naked.\" The king laughed happily. \nRobert Baratheon had always been a man of huge appetites, a man who knew how to take his \npleasures. That was not a charge anyone could lay at the door of Eddard Stark. Yet Ned could not help \nbut notice that those pleasures were taking a toll on the king. Robert was breathing heavily by the time \nthey reached the bottom of the stairs, his face red in the lantern light as they stepped out into the darkness \nof the crypt. \n\"Your Grace,\" Ned said respectfully. He swept the lantern in a wide semicircle. Shadows moved and \nPage 26\n\nlurched. Flickering light touched the stones underfoot and brushed against a long procession of granite \npillars that marched ahead, two by two, into the dark. Between the \npillars, the dead sat on their stone thrones against the walls, backs against the sepulchres that contained \ntheir mortal remains. \"She is down at the end, with Father and Brandon.\" \nHe led the way between the pillars and Robert followed wordlessly, shivering in the subterranean chill. It \nwas always cold down here. Their footsteps rang off the stones and echoed in the vault overhead as they \nwalked among the dead of House Stark. The Lords of Winterfell watched them pass. Their likenesses \nwere carved into the stones that sealed the tombs. In long rows they sat, blind eyes staring out into \neternal darkness, while great stone direwolves curled round their feet. The shifting shadows made the \nstone figures seem to stir as the living passed by. \nBy ancient custom an iron longsword had been laid across the lap of each who had been Lord of \nWinterfell, to keep the vengeful spirits in their crypts. The oldest had long ago rusted away to nothing, \nleaving only a few red stains where the metal had rested on stone. Ned wondered if that meant those \nghosts were free to roam the castle now. He hoped not. The first Lords of Winterfell had been men hard \nas the land they ruled. In the centuries before the Dragonlords came over the sea, they had sworn \nallegiance to no man, styling themselves the Kings in the North. \nNed stopped at last and lifted the oil lantern. The crypt continued on into darkness ahead of them, but \nbeyond this point the tombs were empty and unsealed; black holes waiting for their dead, waiting for him \nand his children. Ned did not like to think on that. \"Here,\" he told his king. \nRobert nodded silently, knelt, and bowed his head. \nThere were three tombs, side by side. Lord Rickard Stark, Ned's father, had a long, stern face. The \nstonemason had known him well. He sat with quiet dignity, stone fingers holding tight to the sword across \nhis lap, but in life all swords had failed him. In two smaller sepulchres on either side were his children. \nBrandon had been twenty when he died, strangled by order of the Mad King Aerys Targaryen only a \nfew short days before he was to wed Catelyn Tully of Riverrun. His father had been forced to watch him \ndie. He was the true heir, the eldest, born to rule. \nLyanna had only been sixteen, a child-woman of surpassing loveliness. Ned had loved her with all his \nheart. Robert had loved her even more. She was to have been his bride. \n\"She was more beautiful than that,\" the king said after a silence. His eyes lingered on Lyanna's face, as if \nhe could will her back to life. Finally he rose, made awkward by his weight. \"Ah, damn it, Ned, did \nyou have to bury her in a place like this?\" His voice was hoarse with remembered grief. \"She deserved \nmore than darkness . . .\" \n\"She was a Stark of Winterfell,\" Ned said quietly. \"This is her place.\" \n\"She should be on a hill somewhere, under a fruit tree, with the sun and clouds above her and the rain to \nwash her clean.\" \n\"I was with her when she died,\" Ned reminded the king. \"She wanted to come home, to rest beside \nBrandon and Father.\" He could hear her still at times. Promise me, she had cried, in a room that smelled \nof blood and roses. Promise me, Ned. The fever had taken her strength and her voice had been faint as a \nPage 27\n\nwhisper, but when he gave her his word, the fear had gone out of his sister's eyes. Ned remembered the \nway she had smiled then, how tightly her fingers had clutched his as she gave up her hold on life, the rose \npetals spilling from her palm, dead and black. After that he remembered nothing. They had found him still \nholding her body, silent with grief. The little crannogman, Howland Reed, had taken her hand from his. \nNed could recall none of it. \"I bring her flowers when I can,\" he said. \"Lyanna was . . . fond of flowers.\" \nThe king touched her cheek, his fingers brushing across the rough stone as gently as if it were living flesh. \n\"I vowed to kill Rhaegar for what he did to her.\" \n\"You did,\" Ned reminded him. \n\"Only once,\" Robert said bitterly. \nThey had come together at the ford of the Trident while the battle crashed around them, Robert with his \nwarhammer and his great antlered helm, the Targaryen prince armored all in black. On his breastplate \nwas the three-headed dragon of his House, wrought all in rubies that flashed like fire in the sunlight. The \nwaters of the Trident ran red around the hooves of their destriers as they circled and clashed, again and \nagain, until at last a crushing blow from Robert's hammer stove in the dragon and the chest beneath it. \nWhen Ned had finally come on the scene, Rhaegar lay dead in the stream, while men of both armies \nscrabbled in the swirling waters for rubies knocked free of his armor. \n\"In my dreams, I kill him every night,\" Robert admitted. \"A thousand deaths will still be less than he \ndeserves.\" \nThere was nothing Ned could say to that. After a quiet, he said, \"We should return, Your Grace. Your \nwife will be waiting.\" \n\"The Others take my wife,\" Robert muttered sourly, but he started back the way they had come, his \nfootsteps falling heavily. \"And if I hear 'Your Grace' once more, I'll have your head on a spike. We are \nmore to each other than that.\" \n\"I had not forgotten,\" Ned replied quietly. When the king did not answer, he said, \"Tell me about Jon.\" \nRobert shook his head. \"I have never seen a man sicken so quickly. We gave a tourney on my son's \nname day. If you had seen Jon then, you would have sworn he would live forever. A fortnight later he \nwas dead. The sickness was like a fire in his gut. It burned right through him.\" He paused beside a pillar, \nbefore the tomb of a long-dead Stark. \"I loved that old man.\" \n\"We both did.\" Ned paused a moment. \"Catelyn fears for her sister. How does Lysa bear her grief?\" \nRobert's mouth gave a bitter twist. \"Not well, in truth,\" he admitted. \"I think losing Jon has driven the \nwoman mad, Ned. She has taken the boy back to the Eyrie. Against my wishes. I had hoped to foster \nhim with Tywin Lannister at Casterly Rock. Jon had no brothers, no other sons. Was I supposed to leave \nhim to be raised by women?\" \nNed would sooner entrust a child to a pit viper than to Lord Tywin, but he left his doubts unspoken. \nSome old wounds never truly heal, and bleed again at the slightest word. \"The wife has lost the husband,\" \nhe said carefully. \"Perhaps-the mother feared to lose the son. The boy is very young.\" \n\"Six, and sickly, and Lord of the Eyrie, gods have mercy,\" the king swore. \"Lord Tywin had never taken \na ward before. Lysa ought to have been honored. The Lannisters are a great and noble House. She \nPage 28\n\nrefused to even hear of it. Then she left in the dead of night, without so much as a by-your-leave. Cersei \nwas furious.\" He sighed deeply. \"The boy is my namesake, did you know that? Robert Arryn. I am \nsworn to protect him. How can I do that if his mother steals him away?\" \n\"I will take him as ward, if you wish,\" Ned said. \"Lysa should consent to that. She and Catelyn were \nclose as girls, and she would be welcome here as well.\" \n\"A generous offer, my friend,\" the king said, \"but too late. Lord Tywin has already given his consent. \nFostering the boy elsewhere would be a grievous affront to him.\" \n\"I have more concern for my nephew's welfare than I do for Lannister pride,\" Ned declared. \n\"That is because you do not sleep with a Lannister.\" Robert laughed, the sound rattling among the tombs \nand bouncing from the vaulted ceiling. His smile was a flash of white teeth in the thicket of the huge black \nbeard. \"Ah, Ned,\" he said, \"you are still too serious.\" He put a massive arm around Ned's shoulders. \"I \nhad planned to wait a few days to speak to you, but I see now there's no need for it. Come, walk with \nme.\" \nThey started back down between the pillars. Blind stone eyes seemed to follow them as they passed. \nThe king kept his arm around Ned's shoulder. \"You must have wondered why I finally came north to \nWinterfell, after so long.\" \nNed had his suspicions, but he did not give them voice. \"For the joy of my company, surely,\" he said \nlightly. \"And there is the Wall. You need to see it, Your Grace, to walk along its battlements and talk to \nthose who man it. The Night's Watch is a shadow of what it once was. Benjen says-\" \n\"No doubt I will hear what your brother says soon enough,\" Robert said. \"The Wall has stood for what, \neight thousand years? It can keep a few days more. I have more pressing concerns. These are difficult \ntimes. I need good men about me. Men like Jon Arryn. He served as Lord of the Eyrie, as Warden of \nthe East, as the Hand of the King. He will not be easy to replace.\" \n\"His son . . .\" Ned began. \n\"His son will succeed to the Eyrie and all its incomes,\" Robert said brusquely. \"No more.\" \nThat took Ned by surprise. He stopped, startled, and turned to look at his king. The words came \nunbidden. \"The Arryns have always been Wardens of the East. The title goes with the domain.\" \n\"Perhaps when he comes of age, the honor can be restored to him,\" Robert said. \"I have this year to \nthink of, and next. A six-year-old boy is no war leader, Ned.\" \n\"In peace, the title is only an honor. Let the boy keep it. For his father's sake if not his own. Surely you \nowe, Jon that much for his service.\" \nThe king was not pleased. He took his arm from around Ned's shoulders. \"Jon's service was the duty he \nowed his liege lord. I am not ungrateful, Ned. You of all men ought to know that. But the son is not the \nfather. A mere boy cannot hold the east.\" Then his tone softened. \"Enough of this. There is a more \nimportant office to discuss, and I would not argue with you.\" Robert grasped Ned by the elbow. \"I have \nneed of you, Ned.\" \n\"I am yours to command, Your Grace. Always.\" They were words he had to say, and so he said them, \nPage 29\n\napprehensive about what might come next. \nRobert scarcely seemed to hear him. \"Those years we spent in the Eyrie . . . gods, those were good \nyears. I want you at my side again, Ned. I want you down in King's Landing, not up here at the end of \nthe world where you are no damned use to anybody.\" Robert looked off into the darkness, for a moment \nas melancholy as a Stark. \"I swear to \nyou, sitting a throne is a thousand times harder than winning one. Laws are a tedious business and \ncounting coppers is worse. And the people . . . there is no end of them. I sit on that damnable iron chair \nand listen to them complain until my mind is numb and my ass is raw. They all want something, money or \nland or justice. The lies they tell . . . and my lords and ladies are no better. I am surrounded by flatterers \nand fools. It can drive a man to madness, Ned. Half of them don't dare tell me the truth, and the other \nhalf can't find it. There are nights I wish we had lost at the Trident. Ah, no, not truly, but \n\"I understand,\" Ned said softly. \nRobert looked at him. \"I think you do. If so, you are the only one, my old friend.\" He smiled. \"Lord \nEddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the King.\" \nNed dropped to one knee. The offer did not surprise him; what other reason could Robert have had for \ncoming so far? The Hand of the King was the second-most powerful man in the Seven Kingdoms. He \nspoke with the king's voice, commanded the king's armies, drafted the king's laws. At times he even sat \nupon the Iron Throne to dispense king's justice, when the king was absent, or sick, or otherwise \nindisposed. Robert was offering him a responsibility as large as the realm itself. \nIt was the last thing in the world he wanted. \n\"Your Grace,\" he said. \"I am not worthy of the honor.\" \nRobert groaned with good-humored impatience. \"If I wanted to honor you, I'd let you retire. I am \nplanning to make you run the kingdom and fight the wars while I eat and drink and wench myself into an \nearly grave.\" He slapped his gut and grinned. \"You know the saying, about the king and his Hand?\" \nNed knew the saying. \"What the king dreams,\" he said, \"the Hand builds.\" \n\"I bedded a fishmaid once who told me the lowborn have a choicer way to put it. The king eats, they \nsay, and the Hand takes the shit.\" He threw back his head and roared his laughter. The echoes rang \nthrough the darkness, and all around them the dead of Winterfell seemed to watch with cold and \ndisapproving eyes. \nFinally the laughter dwindled and stopped. Ned was still on one knee, his eyes upraised. \"Damn it, \nNed,\" the king complained. \"You might at least humor me with a smile.\" \n\"They say it grows so cold up here in winter that a man's laughter freezes in his throat and chokes him to \ndeath,\" Ned said evenly. \"Perhaps that is why the Starks have so little humor.\" \n\"Come south with me, and I'll teach you how to laugh again,\" the \nking promised. \"You helped me win this damnable throne, now help me hold it. We were meant to rule \ntogether. If Lyanna had lived, we should have been brothers, bound by blood as well as affection. Well, \nit is not too late. I have a son. You have a daughter. My Joff and your Sansa shall join our houses, as \nPage 30\n\nLyanna and I might once have done.\" \nThis offer did surprise him. \"Sansa is only eleven.\" \nRobert waved an impatient hand. \"Old enough for betrothal. The marriage can wait a few years.\" The \nking smiled. \"Now stand up and say yes, curse you.\" \n\"Nothing would give me greater pleasure, Your Grace,\" Ned answered. He hesitated. \"These honors are \nall so unexpected. May I have some time to consider? I need to tell my wife . . .\" \n\"Yes, yes, of course, tell Catelyn, sleep on it if you must.\" The king reached down, clasped Ned by the \nhand, and pulled him roughly to his feet. \"Just don't keep me waiting too long. I am not the most patient \nof men.\" \nFor a moment Eddard Stark was filled with a terrible sense of foreboding. This was his place, here in the \nnorth. He looked at the stone figures all around them, breathed deep in the chill silence of the crypt. He \ncould feel the eyes of the dead. They were all listening, he knew. And winter was coming. \nJON \nThere were times-not many, but a few-when Jon Snow was glad he was a bastard. As he filled his wine \ncup once more from a passing flagon, it struck him that this might be one of them. \nHe settled back in his place on the bench among the younger squires and drank. The sweet, fruity taste \nof surnmerwine filled his mouth and brought a smile to his lips. \nThe Great Hall of Winterfell was hazy with smoke and heavy with the smell of roasted meat and \nfresh-baked bread. Its grey stone walls were draped with banners. White, gold, crimson: the direwolf of \nStark, Baratheon's crowned stag, the lion of Lannister. A singer was playing the high harp and reciting a \nballad, but down at this end of the hall his voice could scarcely be heard above the roar of the fire, the \nclangor of pewter plates and cups, and the low mutter of a hundred drunken conversations. \nIt was the fourth hour of the welcoming feast laid for the king. Jon's brothers and sisters had been seated \nwith the royal children, beneath the raised platform where Lord and Lady Stark hosted the king and \nqueen. In honor of the occasion, his lord father would doubtless permit each child a glass of wine, but no \nmore than that. Down here on the benches, there was no one to stop Jon drinking as much as he had a \nthirst for. \nAnd he was finding that he had a man's thirst, to the raucous delight of the youths around him, who urged \nhim on every time he drained a glass. They were fine company, and Jon relished the stories they were \ntelling, tales of battle and bedding and the hunt. He was certain that his companions were more \nentertaining than the king's offspring. He had sated his curiosity about the visitors when they made their \nentrance. The procession had passed not a foot from the place he had been given on the bench, and Jon \nhad gotten a good long look at them all. \nHis lord father had come first, escorting the queen. She was as beautiful as men said. A jeweled tiara \ngleamed amidst her long golden hair, its emeralds a perfect match for the green of her eyes. His father \nhelped her up the steps to the dais and led her to her seat, but the queen never so much as looked at him. \nEven at fourteen, Jon could see through her smile. \nPage 31\n\nNext had come King Robert himself, with Lady Stark on his arm. The king was a great disappointment \nto Jon. His father had talked of him often: the peerless Robert Baratheon, demon of the Trident, the \nfiercest warrior of the realm, a giant among princes. Jon saw only a fat man, red-faced under his beard, \nsweating through his silks. He walked like a man half in his cups. \nAfter them came the children. Little Rickon first, managing the long walk with all the dignity a \nthree-year-old could muster. Jon had to urge him on when he stopped to visit. Close behind came Robb, \nin grey wool trimmed with white, the Stark colors. He had the Princess Myrcella on his arm. She was a \nwisp of a girl, not quite eight, her hair a cascade of golden curls under a jeweled net. Jon noticed the shy \nlooks she gave Robb as they passed between the tables and the timid way she smiled at him. He decided \nshe was insipid. Robb didn't even have the sense to realize how stupid she was; he was grinning like a \nfool. \nHis half sisters escorted the royal princes. Arya was paired with plump young Tommen, whose \nwhite-blond hair was longer than hers. Sansa, two years older, drew the crown prince, Joffrey \nBaratheon. He was twelve, younger than Jon or Robb, but taller than either, to Jon's vast dismay. Prince \nJoffrey had his sister's hair and his mother's deep green eyes. A thick tangle of blond curls dripped down \npast his golden choker and high velvet collar. Sansa looked radiant as she walked beside him, but Jon \ndid not like Joffrey's pouty lips or the bored, disdainful way he looked at Winterfell's Great Hall. \nHe was more interested in the pair that came behind him: the queen's brothers, the Lannisters of Casterly \nRock. The Lion and the Imp; there was no mistaking which was which. Ser Jaime Lannister was \ntwin to Queen Cersei; tall and golden, with flashing green eyes and a smile that cut like a knife. He wore \ncrimson silk, high black boots, a black satin cloak. On the breast of his tunic, the lion of his House was \nembroidered in gold thread, roaring its defiance. They called him the Lion of Lannister to his face and \nwhispered \"Kingslayer\" behind his back. \nJon found it hard to look away from him. This is what a king should look like, he thought to himself as \nthe man passed. \nThen he saw the other one, waddling along half-hidden by his brother's side. Tyrion Lannister, the \nyoungest of Lord Tywin's brood and by far the ugliest. All that the gods had given to Cersei and Jaime, \nthey had denied Tyrion. He was a dwarf, half his brother's height, struggling to keep pace on stunted legs. \nHis head was too large for his body, with a brute's squashed-in face beneath a swollen shelf of brow. \nOne green eye and one black one peered out from under a lank fall of hair so blond it seemed white. Jon \nwatched him with fascination. \nThe last of the high lords to enter were his uncle, Benjen Stark of the Night's Watch, and his father's \nward, young Theon Greyjoy. Benjen gave Jon a warm smile as he went by. Theon ignored him utterly, \nbut there was nothing new in that. After all had been seated, toasts were made, thanks were given and \nreturned, and then the feasting began. \nJon had started drinking then, and he had not stopped. \nSomething rubbed against his leg beneath the table. Jon saw red eyes staring up at him. \"Hungry again?\" \nhe asked. There was still half a honeyed chicken in the center of the table. Jon reached out to tear off a \nleg, then had a better idea. He knifed the bird whole and let the carcass slide to the floor between his \nlegs. Ghost ripped into it in savage silence. His brothers and sisters had not been permitted to bring their \nwolves to the banquet, but there were more curs than Jon could count at this end of the hall, and no one \nPage 32\n\nhad said a word about his pup. He told himself he was fortunate in that too. \nHis eyes stung. Jon rubbed at them savagely, cursing the smoke. He swallowed another gulp of wine and \nwatched his direwolf devour the chicken. \nDogs moved between the tables, trailing after the serving girls. One of them, a black mongrel bitch with \nlong yellow eyes, caught a scent of the chicken. She stopped and edged under the bench to get a share. \nJon watched the confrontation. The bitch growled low in her throat and moved closer. Ghost looked up, \nsilent, and fixed the dog with those hot red eyes. The bitch snapped an angry challenge. She was three \ntimes the size of the direwolf pup. Ghost did not move. He stood \nover his prize and opened his mouth, baring his fangs. The bitch tensed, barked again, then thought \nbetter of this fight. She turned and slunk away, with one last defiant snap to save her pride. Ghost went \nback to his meal. \nJon grinned and reached under the table to ruffle the shaggy white fur. The direwolf looked up at him, \nnipped gently at his hand, then went back to eating. \n\"Is this one of the direwolves I've heard so much of?\" a familiar voice asked close at hand. \nJon looked up happily as his uncle Ben put a hand on his head and ruffled his hair much as Jon had \nruffled the wolf s. \"Yes,\" he said. \"His name is Ghost.\" \nOne of the squires interrupted the bawdy story he'd been telling to make room at the table for their lord's \nbrother. Benjen Stark straddled the bench with,long legs and took the wine cup out of Jon's hand. \n\"Summerwine,\" he said after a taste. \"Nothing so sweet. How many cups have you had, Jon?\" \nJon smiled. \nBen Stark laughed. \"As I feared. Ah, well. I believe I was younger than you the first time I got truly and \nsincerely drunk.\" He snagged a roasted onion, dripping brown with gravy, from a nearby trencher and bit \ninto it. It crunched. \nHis uncle was sharp-featured and gaunt as a mountain crag, but there was always a hint of laughter in his \nblue-grey eyes. He dressed in black, as befitted a man of the Night's Watch. Tonight it was rich black \nvelvet, with high leather boots and a wide belt with a silver buckle. A heavy silver chain was looped \nround his neck. Benjen watched Ghost with amusement as he ate his onion. \"A very quiet wolf,\" he \nobserved. \n\"He's not like the others,\" Jon said. \"He never makes a sound. That's why I named him Ghost. That, and \nbecause he's white. The others are all dark, grey or black.\" \n\"There are still direwolves beyond the Wall. We hear them on our rangings.\" Benjen Stark gave Jon a \nlong look. \"Don't you usually eat at table with your brothers?\" \n\"Most times,\" Jon answered in a flat voice. \"But tonight Lady Stark thought it might give insult to the \nroyal family to seat a bastard among them.\" \n\"I see.\" His uncle glanced over his shoulder at the raised table at the far end of the hall. \"My brother \ndoes not seem very festive tonight.\" \nPage 33\n\nJon had noticed that too. A bastard had to learn to notice things, to read the truth that people hid behind \ntheir eyes. His father was observing \nall the courtesies, but there was tightness in him that Jon had seldom seen before. He said little, \nlooking out over the hall with hooded eyes, seeing nothing. Two seats away, the king had been drinking \nheavily all night. His broad face was flushed behind his great black beard. He made many a toast, \nlaughed loudly at every jest, and attacked each dish like a starving man, but beside him the queen seemed \nas cold as an ice sculpture. \"The queen is angry too,\" Jon told his uncle in a low, quiet voice. \"Father took \nthe king down to the crypts this afternoon. The queen didn't want him to go.\" \nBenjen gave Jon a careful, measuring look. \"You don't miss much, do you, Jon? We could use a man \nlike you on the Wall.\" \nJon swelled with pride. \"Robb is a stronger lance than I am, but I'm the better sword, and Hullen says I \nsit a horse as well as anyone in the castle.\" \n\"Notable achievements.\" \n\"Take me with you when you go back to the Wall,\" Jon said in a sudden rush. \"Father will give me leave \nto go if you ask him, I know he will.\" \nUncle Benjen studied his face carefully. \"The Wall is a hard place for a boy, Jon.\" \n\"I am almost a man grown,\" Jon protested. \"I will turn fifteen on my next name day, and Maester Luwin \nsays bastards grow up faster than other children.\" \n\"That's true enough,\" Benjen said with a downward twist of his mouth. He took Jon's cup from the table, \nfilled it fresh from a nearby pitcher, and drank down a long swallow. \n\"Daeren Targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered Dorne,\" Jon said. The Young Dragon was \none of his heroes. \n\"A conquest that lasted a summer,\" his uncle pointed out. \"Your Boy King lost ten thousand men taking \nthe place, and another fifty trying to hold it. Someone should have told him that war isn't a game.\" He \ntook another sip of wine. \"Also,\" he said, wiping his mouth, \"Daeren Targaryen was only eighteen when \nhe died. Or have you forgotten that part?\" \n\"I forget nothing,\" Jon boasted. The wine was making him bold. He tried to sit very straight, to make \nhimself seem taller. \"I want to serve in the Night's Watch, Uncle.\" \nHe had thought on it long and hard, lying abed at night while his brothers slept around him. Robb would \nsomeday inherit Winterfell, would command great armies as the Warden of the North. Bran and Rickon \nwould be Robb's bannermen and rule holdfasts in his name. His sisters Arya and Sansa would marry the \nheirs of other great houses \nand go south as mistress of castles of their own. But what place could a bastard hope to earn? \n\"You don't know what you're asking, Jon. The Night's Watch is a sworn brotherhood. We have no \nfamilies. None of us will ever father sons. Our wife is duty. Our mistress is honor.\" \n\"A bastard can have honor too,\" Jon said. \"I am ready to swear your oath.\" \nPage 34\n\n\"You are a boy of fourteen,\" Benjen said. \"Not a man, not yet. Until you have known a woman, you \ncannot understand what you would be giving up.\" \n\"I don't care about that!\" Jon said hotly. \n\"You might, if you knew what it meant,\" Benjen said. \"If you knew what the oath would cost you, you \nmight be less eager to pay the price, son.\" \nJon felt anger rise inside him. \"I'm not your son!\" \nBenjen Stark stood up. \"More's the pity.\" He put a hand on Jon's shoulder. \"Come back to me after \nyou've fathered a few bastards of your own, and we'll see how you feel.\" \nJon trembled. \"I will never father a bastard,\" he said carefully. \"Never!\" He spat it out like venom. \nSuddenly he realized that the table had fallen silent, and they were all looking at him. He felt the tears \nbegin to well behind his eyes. He pushed himself to his feet. \n\"I must be excused,\" he said with the last of his dignity. He whirled and bolted before they could see him \ncry. He must have drunk more wine than he had realized. His feet got tangled under him as he tried to \nleave, and he lurched sideways into a serving girl and sent a flagon of spiced wine crashing to the floor. \nLaughter boomed all around him, and Jon felt hot tears on his cheeks. Someone tried to steady him. He \nwrenched free of their grip and ran, half-blind, for the door. Ghost followed close at his heels, out into the \nnight. \nThe yard was quiet and empty. A lone sentry stood high on the battlements of the inner wall, his cloak \npulled tight around him against the cold. He looked bored and miserable as he huddled there alone, but \nJon would have traded places with him in an instant. Otherwise the castle was dark and deserted. Jon \nhad seen an abandoned holdfast once, a drear place where nothing moved but the wind and the stones \nkept silent about whatever people had lived there. Winterfell reminded him of that tonight. \nThe sounds of music and song spilled through the open windows behind him. They were the last things \nJon wanted to hear. He wiped \naway his tears on the sleeve of his shirt, furious that he had let them fall, and turned to go. \n\"Boy,\" a voice called out to him. Jon turned. \nTyrion Lannister was sitting on the ledge above the door to the Great Hall, looking for all the world like \na gargoyle. The dwarf grinned down at him. \"Is that animal a wolf?\" \n\"A direwolf,\" Jon said. \"His name is Ghost.\" He stared up at the little man, his disappointment suddenly \nforgotten. \"What are you doing up there? Why aren't you at the feast?\" \n\"Too hot, too noisy, and I'd drunk too much wine,\" the dwarf told him. \"I learned long ago that it is \nconsidered rude to vomit on your brother. Might I have a closer look at your wolf?\" \nJon hesitated, then nodded slowly. \"Can you climb down, or shall I bring a ladder?\" \n\"Oh, bleed that,\" the little man said. He pushed himself off the ledge into empty air. Jon gasped, then \nPage 35\n\nwatched with awe as Tyrion Lannister spun around in a tight ball, landed lightly on his hands, then vaulted \nbackward onto his legs. \nGhost backed away from him uncertainly. \nThe dwarf dusted himself off and laughed. \"I believe I've frightened your wolf. My apologies.\" \n\"He's not scared,\" Jon said. He knelt and called out. \"Ghost, come here. Come on. That's it.\" \nThe wolf pup padded closer and nuzzled at Jon's face, but he kept a wary eye on Tyrion Lannister, and \nwhen the dwarf reached out to pet him, he drew back and bared his fangs in a silent snarl. \"Shy, isn't he?\" \nLannister observed. \n\"Sit, Ghost,\" Jon commanded. \"That's it. Keep still.\" He looked up at the dwarf. \"You can touch him \nnow. He won't move until I tell him to. I've been training him.\" \n\"I see,\" Lannister said. He ruffled the snow-white fur between Ghost's ears and said, \"Nice wolf.\" \n\"If I wasn't here, he'd tear out your throat,\" Jon said. It wasn't actually true yet, but it would be. \n\"In that case, you had best stay close,\" the dwarf said. He cocked his oversized head to one side and \nlooked Jon over with his mismatched eyes. \"I am Tyrion Lannister.\" \n\"I know,\" Jon said. He rose. Standing, he was taller than the dwarf. It made him feel strange. \n\"You're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?\" \nJon felt a coldness pass right through him. He pressed his lips together and said nothing. \n\"Did I offend you?\" Lannister said. \"Sorry. Dwarfs don't have to be tactful. Generations of capering fools \nin motley have won me the right to dress badly and say any damn thing that comes into my head.\" He \ngrinned. \"You are the bastard, though.\" \n\"Lord Eddard Stark is my father,\" Jon admitted stiffly. \nLannister studied his face. \"Yes,\" he said. \"I can see it. You have more of the north in you than your \nbrothers.\" \n\"Half brothers,\" Jon corrected. He was pleased by the dwarf s comment, but he tried not to let it show. \n\"Let me give you some counsel, bastard,\" Lannister said. \"Never forget what you are, for surely the \nworld will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armor yourself in it, and it \nwill never be used to hurt you.\" \nJon was in no mood for anyone's counsel. \"What do you know about being a bastard?\" \n\"All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes.\" \n\"You are your mother's trueborn son of Lannister.\" \n\"Am I\" the dwarf replied, sardonic. \"Do tell my lord father. MY mother died birthing me, and he's never \nPage 36\n\nbeen sure.\" \n\"I don't even know who my mother was,\" Jon said. \n\"Some woman, no doubt. Most of them are.\" He favored Jon with a rueful grin. \"Remember this, boy. \nAll dwarfs may be bastards, yet not all bastards need be dwarfs.\" And with that he turned and sauntered \nback into the feast, whistling a tune. When he opened the door, the light from within threw his shadow \nclear across the yard, and for just a moment Tyrion Lannister stood tall as a king. \nCATELYN \n0f all the rooms in Winterfell's Great Keep, Catelyn's bedchambers were the hottest. She seldom had to \nlight a fire. The castle had been built over natural hot springs, and the scalding waters rushed through its \nwalls and chambers like blood through a man's body, driving the chill from the stone halls, filling the glass \ngardens with a moist warmth, keeping the earth from freezing. Open pools smoked day and night in a \ndozen small courtyards. That was a little thing, in summer; in winter, it was the difference between life and \ndeath. \nCatelyn's bath was always hot and steaming, and her walls warm to the touch. The warmth reminded her \nof Riverrun, of days in the sun with Lysa and Edmure, but Ned could never abide the heat. The Starks \nwere made for the cold, he would tell her, and she would laugh and tell him in that case they had certainly \nbuilt their castle in the wrong place. \nSo when they had finished, Ned rolled off and climbed from her bed, as he had a thousand times before. \nHe crossed the room, pulled back the heavy tapestries, and threw open the high narrow windows one by \none, letting the night air into the chamber. \nThe wind swirled around him as he stood facing the dark, naked and empty-handed. Catelyn pulled the \nfurs to her chin and watched him. He looked somehow smaller and more vulnerable, like the youth she \nhad wed in the sept at Riverrun, fifteen long years gone. Her loins \nstill ached from the urgency of his lovernaking. It was a good ache. She could feel his seed within her. \nShe prayed that it might quicken there. It had been three years since Rickon. She was not too old. She \ncould give him another son. \n\"I will refuse him,\" Ned said as he turned back to her. His eyes were haunted, his voice thick with doubt. \nCatelyn sat up in the bed. \"You cannot. You must not.\" \n\"My duties are here in the north. I have no wish to be Robert's Hand.\" \n\"He will not understand that. He is a king now, and kings are not like other men. If you refuse to serve \nhim, he will wonder why, and sooner or later he will begin to suspect that you oppose him. Can't you see \nthe danger that would put us in?\" \nNed shook his head, refusing to believe. \"Robert would never harm me or any of mine. We were closer \nthan brothers. He loves me. If I refuse him, he will roar and curse and bluster, and in a week we will \nlaugh about it together. I know the man!\" \nPage 37\n\n\"You knew the man,\" she said. \"The king is a stranger to you.\" Catelyn remembered the direwolf dead in \nthe snow, the broken antler lodged deep in her throat. She had to make him see. \"Pride is everything to a \nking, my lord. Robert came all this way to see you, to bring you these great honors, you cannot throw \nthem back in his face.\" \n\"Honors?\" Ned laughed bitterly. \n\"In his eyes, yes,\" she said. \n\"And in yours?\" \n\"And in mine,\" she blazed, angry now. Why couldn't he see? \"He offers his own son in marriage to our \ndaughter, what else would you call that? Sansa might someday be queen. Her sons could rule from the \nWall to the mountains of Dorne. What is so wrong with that?\" \n\"Gods, Catelyn, Sansa is only eleven,\" Ned said. \"And Joffrey . . . Joffrey is . . .\" \nShe finished for him. crown prince, and heir to the Iron Throne. And I was only twelve when my father \npromised me to your brother Brandon.\" \nThat brought a bitter twist to Ned's mouth. \"Brandon. Yes. Brandon would know what to do. He \nalways did. It was all meant for Brandon. You, Winterfell, everything. He was born to be a King's Hand \nand a father to queens. I never asked for this cup to pass to me.\" \n\"Perhaps not,\" Catelyn said, \"but Brandon is dead, and the cup has passed, and you must drink from it, \nlike it or not.\" \nNed turned away from her, back to the night. He stood staring out \nin the darkness, watching the moon and the stars perhaps, or perhaps the sentries on the wall. \nCatelyn softened then, to see his pain. Eddard Stark had married her in Brandon's place, as custom \ndecreed, but the shadow of his dead brother still lay between them, as did the other, the shadow of the \nwoman he would not name, the woman who had borne him his bastard son. \nShe was about to go to him when the knock came at the door, loud and unexpected. Ned turned, \nfrowning. \"What is it?\" \nDesmond's voice came through the door. \"My lord, Maester Luwin is without and begs urgent \naudience.\" \n\"You told him I had left orders not to be disturbed?\" \n\"Yes, my lord. He insists.\" \n\"Very well. Send him in.\" \nNed crossed to the wardrobe and slipped on a heavy robe. Catelyn realized suddenly how cold it had \nbecome. She sat up in bed and pulled the furs to her chin. \"Perhaps we should close the windows,\" she \nsuggested. \nPage 38\n\nNed nodded absently. Maester Luwin was shown in. \nThe maester was a small grey man. His eyes were grey, and quick, and saw much. His hair was grey, \nwhat little the years had left him. His robe was grey wool, trimmed with white fur, the Stark colors. Its \ngreat floppy sleeves had pockets hidden inside. Luwin was always tucking things into those sleeves and \nproducing other things from them: books, messages, strange artifacts, toys for the children. With all he \nkept hidden in his sleeves, Catelyn was surprised that Maester Luwin could lift his arms at all. \nThe maester waited until the door had closed behind him before he spoke. \"My lord,\" he said to Ned, \n\"pardon for disturbing your rest. I have been left a message.\" \nNed looked irritated. \"Been left? By whom? Has there been a rider? I was not told.\" \n\"There was no rider, my lord. Only a carved wooden box, left on a table in my observatory while I \nnapped. My servants saw no one, but it must have been brought by someone in the king's party. We \nhave had no other visitors from the south.\" \n\"A wooden box, you say?\" Catelyn said. \n\"Inside was a fine new lens for the observatory, from Myr by the look of it. The lenscrafters of Myr are \nwithout equal.\" \nNed frowned. He had little patience for this sort of thing, Catelyn knew. \"A lens,\" he said. \"What has \nthat to do with me?\" \n\"I asked the same question,\" Maester Luwin said. \"Clearly there was more to this than the seeming.\" \nUnder the heavy weight of her furs, Catelyn shivered. \"A lens is an instrument to help us see.\" \n\"Indeed it is.\" He fingered the collar of his order; a heavy chain worn tight around the neck beneath his \nrobe, each link forged from a different metal. \nCatelyn could feel dread stirring inside her once again. \"What is it that they would have us see more \nclearly?\" \n\"The very thing I asked myself.\" Maester Luwin drew a tightly rolled paper out of his sleeve. \"I found the \ntrue message concealed within a false bottom when I dismantled the box the lens had come in, but it is \nnot for my eyes.\" \nNed held out his hand. \"Let me have it, then.\" \nLuwin did not stir. \"Pardons, my lord. The message is not for you either. It is marked for the eyes of the \nLady Catelyn, and her alone. May I approach?\" \nCatelyn nodded, not trusting to speak. The maester placed the paper on the table beside the bed. It was \nsealed with a small blob of blue wax. Luwin bowed and began to retreat. \n\"Stay,\" Ned commanded him. His voice was grave. He looked at Catelyn. \"What is it? My lady, you're \nshaking.\" \n\"I'm afraid,\" she admitted. She reached out and took the letter in trembling hands. The furs dropped \nPage 39\n\naway from her nakedness, forgotten. In the blue wax was the moon-and-falcon seal of House Arryn. \"It's \nfrom Lysa.\" Catelyn looked at her husband. \"It will not make us glad,\" she told him. \"There is grief in this \nmessage, Ned. I can feel it.\" \nNed frowned, his face darkening. \"Open it.\" \nCatelyn broke the seal. \nHer eyes moved over the words. At first they made no sense to her. Then she remembered. \"Lysa took \nno chances. When we were girls together, we had a private language, she and L\" \n\"Can you read it?\" \n\"Yes,\" Catelyn admitted. \n\"Then tell us.\" \n\"Perhaps I should withdraw,\" Maester Luwin said. \n\"No,\" Catelyn said. \"We will need your counsel.\" She threw back the furs and climbed from the bed. \nThe night air was as cold as the grave on her bare skin as she padded across the room. \nMaester Luwin averted his eyes. Even Ned looked shocked. \"What are you doing?\" he asked. \n\"Lighting a fire,\" Catelyn told him. She found a dressing gown and shrugged into it, then knelt over the \ncold hearth. \n\"Maester Luwin-\" Ned began. \n\"Maester Luwin has delivered all my children,\" Catelyn said. \"This is no time for false modesty.\" She slid \nthe paper in among the kindling and placed the heavier logs on top of it. \nNed crossed the room, took her by the arm, and pulled her to her feet. He held her there, his face inches \nfrom her. \"My lady, tell me! What was this message?\" \nCatelyn stiffened in his grasp. \"A warning,\" she said softly. \"If we have the wits to hear.\" \nHis eyes searched her face. \"Go on.\" \n\"Lysa says Jon Arryn was murdered.\" \nHis fingers tightened on her arm. \"By whom?\" \n\"The Lannisters,\" she told him. \"The queen.\" \nNed released his hold on her arm. There were deep red marks on her skin. \"Gods,\" he whispered. His \nvoice was hoarse. \"Your sister is sick with grief. She cannot know what she is saying.\" \n\"She knows,\" Catelyn said. \"Lysa is impulsive, yes, but this message was carefully planned, cleverly \nhidden. She knew it meant death if her letter fell into the wrong hands. To risk so much, she must have \nhad more than mere suspicion.\" Catelyn looked to her husband. \"Now we truly have no choice. You \nPage 40\n\nmust be Robert's Hand. You must go south with him and learn the truth.\" \nShe saw at once that Ned had reached a very different conclusion. \"The only truths I know are here. \nThe south is a nest of adders I would do better to avoid.\" \nLuwin plucked at his chain collar where it had chafed the soft skin of his throat. \"The Hand of the King \nhas great power, my lord. Power to find the truth of Lord Arryn's death, to bring his killers to the king's \njustice. Power to protect Lady Arryn and her son, if the worst be true.\" \nNed glanced helplessly around the bedchamber. Catelyn's heart went out to him, but she knew she \ncould not take him in her arms just then. First the victory must be won, for her children's sake. \"You say \nyou love Robert like a brother. Would you leave your brother surrounded by Lannisters?\" \n\"The Others take both of you,\" Ned muttered darkly. He turned away from them and went to the \nwindow. She did not speak, nor did the maester. They waited, quiet, while Eddard Stark said a silent \nfarewell to the home he loved. When he turned away from the window at last, his voice was tired and full \nof melancholy, and moisture glittered \nfaintly in the corners of his eyes. \"My father went south once, to answer the summons of a king. He \nnever came home again.\" \n\"A different time,\" Maester Luwin said. \"A different king.\" \n\"Yes,\" Ned said dully. He seated himself in a chair by the hearth. \"Catelyn, you shall stay here in \nWinterfell.\" \nHis words were like an icy draft through her heart. \"No,\" she said, suddenly afraid. Was this to be her \npunishment? Never to see his face again, nor to feel his arms around her? \n\"Yes,\" Ned said, in words that would brook no argument. \"You must govern the north in my stead, while \nI run Robert's errands. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. Robb is fourteen. Soon enough, he \nwill be a man grown. He must learn to rule, and I will not be here for him. Make him part of your \ncouncils. He must be ready when his time comes.\" \n\"Gods will, not for many years,\" Maester Luwin murmured. \n\"Maester Luwin, I trust you as I would my own blood. Give my wife your voice in all things great and \nsmall. Teach my son the things he needs to know. Winter is coming.\" \nMaester Luwin nodded gravely. Then silence fell, until Catelyn found her courage and asked the \nquestion whose answer she most dreaded. \"What of the other children?\" \nNed stood, and took her in his arms, and held her face close to his. \"Rickon is very young,\" he said \ngently. \"He should stay here with you and Robb. The others I would take with me.\" \n\"I could not bear it,\" Catelyn said, trembling. \n\"You must,\" he said. \"Sansa must wed Joffrey, that is clear now, we must give them no grounds to \nsuspect our devotion. And it is past time that Arya learned the ways of a southron court. In a few years \nshe will be of an age to marry too.\" \nPage 41\n\nSansa would shine in the south, Catelyn thought to herself, and the gods knew that Arya needed \nrefinement. Reluctantly, she let go of them in her heart. But not Bran. Never Bran. \"Yes,\" she said, \"but \nplease, Ned, for the love you bear me, let Bran remain here at Winterfell. He is only seven.\" \n\"I was eight when my father sent me to foster at the Eyrie,\" Ned said. \"Ser Rodrik tells me there is bad \nfeeling between Robb and Prince Joffrey. That is not healthy. Bran can bridge that distance. He is a \nsweet boy, quick to laugh, easy to love. Let him grow up with the young princes, let him become their \nfriend as Robert became mine. Our House will be the safer for it.\" \nHe was right; Catelyn knew it. It did not make the pain any easier to bear. She would lose all four of \nthem, then: Ned, and both girls, and \nher sweet, loving Bran. Only Robb and little Rickon would be left to her. She felt lonely already. \nWinterfell was such a vast place. \"Keep him off the walls, then,\" she said bravely. \"You know how Bran \nloves to climb.\" \nNed kissed the tears from her eyes before they could fall. \"Thank you, my lady,\" he whispered. \"This is \nhard, I know.\" \n\"What of Jon Snow, my lord?\" Maester Luwin asked. \nCatelyn tensed at the mention of the name. Ned felt the anger in her, and pulled away. \nMany men fathered bastards. Catelyn had grown up with that knowledge. It came as no surprise to her, \nin the first year of her marriage, to learn that Ned had fathered a child on some girl chance met on \ncampaign. He had a man's needs, after all, and they had spent that year apart, Ned off at war in the south \nwhile she remained safe in her father's castle at Riverrun. Her thoughts were more of Robb, the infant at \nher breast, than of the husband she scarcely knew. He was welcome to whatever solace he might find \nbetween battles. And if his seed quickened, she expected he would see to the child's needs. \nHe did more than that. The Starks were not like other men. Ned brought his bastard home with him, and \ncalled him \"son\" for all the north to see. When the wars were over at last, and Catelyn rode to Winterfell, \nJon and his wet nurse had already taken up residence. \nThat cut deep. Ned would not speak of the mother, not so much as a word, but a castle has no secrets, \nand Catelyn heard her maids repeating tales they heard from the lips of her husband's soldiers. They \nwhispered of Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, deadliest of the seven knights of Aerys's \nKingsguard, and of how their young lord had slain him in single combat. And they told how afterward \nNed had carried Ser Arthur's sword back to the beautiful young sister who awaited him in a castle called \nStarfall on the shores of the Summer Sea. The Lady Ashara Dayne, tall and fair, with haunting violet \neyes. It had taken her a fortnight to marshal her courage, but finally, in bed one night, Catelyn had asked \nher husband the truth of it, asked him to his face. \nThat was the only time in all their years that Ned had ever frightened her. \"Never ask me about Jon,\" he \nsaid, cold as ice. \"He is my blood, and that is all you need to know. And now I will learn where you \nheard that name, my lady.\" She had pledged to obey; she told him; and from that day on, the whispering \nhad stopped, and Ashara Dayne's name was never heard in Winterfell again. \nWhoever Jon's mother had been, Ned must have loved her fiercely, for nothing Catelyn said would \npersuade him to send the boy away. It \nPage 42\n\nwas the one thing she could never forgive him. She had come to love her husband with all her heart, but \nshe had never found it in her to love Jon. She might have overlooked a dozen bastards for Ned's sake, \nso long as they were out of sight. Jon was never out of sight, and as he grew, he looked more like Ned \nthan any of the trueborn sons she bore him. Somehow that made it worse. \"Jon must go,\" she said now. \n\"He and Robb are close,\" Ned said. \"I had hoped . . .\" \n\"He cannot stay here,\" Catelyn said, cutting him off. \"He is your son, not mine. I will not have him.\" It \nwas hard, she knew, but no less the truth. Ned would do the boy no kindness by leaving him here at \nWinterfell. \nThe look Ned gave her was anguished. \"You know I cannot take him south. There will be no place for \nhim at court. A boy with a bastard's name . . . you know what they will say of him. He will be shunned.\" \nCatelyn armored her heart against the mute appeal in her husband's eyes. \"They say your friend Robert \nhas fathered a dozen bastards himself.\" \n\"And none of them has ever been seen at court!\" Ned blazed. \"The Lann.ister woman has seen to that. \nHow can you be so damnably cruel, Catelyn? He is only a boy. He-\" \nHis fury was on him. He might have said more, and worse, but Maester Luwin cut in. \"Another solution \npresents itself,\" he said, his voice quiet. \"Your brother Benjen came to me about Jon a few days ago. It \nseems the boy aspires to take the black.\" \nNed looked shocked. \"He asked to join the Night's Watch?\" \nCatelyn said nothing. Let Ned work it out in his own mind; her voice would not be welcome now. Yet \ngladly would she have kissed the maester just then. His was the perfect solution. Benjen Stark was a \nSworn Brother. Jon would be a son to him, the child he would never have. And in time the boy would \ntake the oath as well. He would father no sons who might someday contest with Catelyn's own \ngrandchildren for Winterfell. \nMaester Luwin said, \"There is great honor in service on the Wall, my lord.\" \n\"And even a bastard may rise high in the Night's Watch,\" Ned reflected. Still, his voice was troubled. \n\"Jon is so young. If he asked this when he was a man grown, that would be one thing, but a boy of \nfourteen . . .\" \n\"A hard sacrifice,\" Maester Luwin agreed. \"Yet these are hard times, my lord. His road is no crueler \nthan yours or your lady's.11 \nCatelyn thought of the three children she must lose. It was not easy keeping silent then. \nNed turned away from them to gaze out the window, his long face silent and thoughtful. Finally he \nsighed, and turned back. \"Very well,\" he said to Maester Luwin. \"I suppose it is for the best. I will speak \nto Ben.\" \n\"When shall we tell Jon?\" the maester asked. \n\"When I must. Preparations must be made. It will be a fortnight before we are ready to depart. I would \nsooner let Jon enjoy these last few days. Summer will end soon enough, and childhood as well. When the \nPage 43\n\ntime comes, I will tell him myself.\" \nARYA \nA rya's stitches were crooked again. \nShe frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister Sansa sat among the other \ngirls. Sansa's needlework was exquisite. Everyone said so. \"Sansa's work is as pretty as she is,\" Septa \nMordane told their lady mother once. \"She has such fine, delicate hands.\" When Lady Catelyn had asked \nabout Arya, the septa had sniffed. \"Arya has the hands of a blacksmith.\" \nArya glanced furtively across the room, worried that Septa Mordane might have read her thoughts, but \nthe septa was paying her no attention today. She was sitting with the Princess Myrcella, all smiles and \nadmiration. It was not often that the septa was privileged to instruct a royal princess in the womanly arts, \nas she had said when the queen brought Myrcella to join them. Arya thought that Myrcella's stitches \nlooked a little crooked too, but you would never know it from the way Septa Mordane was cooing. \nShe studied her own work again, looking for some way to salvage it, then sighed and put down the \nneedle. She looked glumly at her sister. Sansa was chatting away happily as she worked. Beth Cassel, \nSer Rodrik's little girl, was sitting by her feet, listening to every word she said, and Jeyne Poole was \nleaning over to whisper something in her ear. \n\"What are you talking about?\" Arya asked suddenly. \nJeyne gave her a startled look, then giggled. Sansa looked abashed. Beth blushed. No one answered. \n\"Tell me,\" Arya said. \nJeyne glanced over to make certain that Septa Mordane was not listening. Myrcella said something then, \nand the septa laughed along with the rest of the ladies. \n\"We were talking about the prince,\" Sansa said, her voice soft as a kiss. \nArya knew which prince she meant: Jofftey, of course. The tall, handsome one. Sansa got to sit with him \nat the feast. Arya had to sit with the little fat one. Naturally. \n\"Joffrey likes your sister,\" Jeyne whispered, proud as if she had something to do with it. She was the \ndaughter of Winterfell's steward and Sansa's dearest friend. \"He told her she was very beautiful.\" \n\"He's going to marry her,\" little Beth said dreamily, hugging herself. \"Then Sansa will be queen of all the \nrealm.\" \nSansa had the grace to blush. She blushed prettily. She did everything prettily, Arya thought with dull \nresentment. \"Beth, you shouldn't make up stories,\" Sansa corrected the younger girl, gently stroking her \nhair to take the harshness out of her words. She looked at Arya. \"What did you think of Prince Joff, \nsister? He's very gallant, don't you think?\" \n\"Jon says he looks like a girl,\" Arya said. \nPage 44\n\nSansa sighed as she stitched. \"Poor Jon,\" she said. \"He gets jealous because he's a bastard.\" \n\"He's our brother,\" Arya said, much too loudly. Her voice cut through the afternoon quiet of the tower \nroom. \nSepta Mordane raised her eyes. She had a bony face, sharp eyes, and a thin lipless mouth made for \nfrowning. It was frowning now. \"What are you talking about, children?\" \n\"Our half brother,\" Sansa corrected, soft and precise. She smiled for the septa. \"Arya and I were \nremarking on how pleased we were to have the princess with us today,\" she said. \nSepta Mordane nodded. \"Indeed. A great honor for us all.\" Princess Myrcella smiled uncertainly at the \ncompliment. \"Arya, why aren't you at work?\" the septa asked. She rose to her feet, starched skirts \nrustling as she started across the room. \"Let me see your stitches.\" \nArya wanted to scream. It was just like Sansa to go and attract the septa's attention. \"Here,\" she said, \nsurrendering up her work. \nThe septa examined the fabric. \"Arya, Arya, Arya,\" she said. \"This will not do. This will not do at all.\" \nEveryone was looking at her. It was too much. Sansa was too well bred to smile at her sister's disgrace, \nbut Jeyne was smirking on her \nbehalf. Even Princess Myrcella looked sorry for her. Arya felt tears filling her eyes. She pushed herself \nout of her chair and bolted for the door. \nSepta Mordane called after her. \"Arya, come back here! Don't you take another step! Your lady mother \nwill hear of this. In front of our royal princess too! You'll shame us all!\" \nArya stopped at the door and turned back, biting her lip. The tears were running down her cheeks now. \nShe managed a stiff little bow to Myrcella. \"By your leave, my lady.\" \nMyrcella blinked at her and looked to her ladies for guidance. But if she was uncertain, Septa Mordane \nwas not. \"Just where do you think you are going, Arya?\" the septa demanded. \nArya glared at her. \"I have to go shoe a horse,\" she said sweetly, taking a brief satisfaction in the shock \non the septa's face. Then she whirled and made her exit, running down the steps as fast as her feet would \ntake her. \nIt wasn't fair. Sansa had everything. Sansa was two years older; maybe by the time Arya had been born, \nthere had been nothing left. Often it felt that way. Sansa could sew and dance and sing. She wrote \npoetry. She knew how to dress. She played the high harp and the bells. Worse, she was beautiful. Sansa \nhad gotten their mother's fine high cheekbones and the thick auburn hair of the Tullys. Arya took after \ntheir lord father. Her hair was a lusterless brown, and her face was long and solemn. Jeyne used to call \nher Arya Horseface, and neigh whenever she came near. It hurt that the one thing Arya could do better \nthan her sister was ride a horse. Well, that and manage a household. Sansa had never had much of a \nhead for figures. If she did marry Prince Joff, Arya hoped for his sake that he had a good steward. \nNymeria was waiting for her in the guardroom at the base of the stairs. She bounded to her feet as soon \nas she caught sight of Arya. Arya grinned. The wolf pup loved her, even if no one else did. They went \neverywhere together, and Nymeria slept in her room, at the foot of her bed. If Mother had not forbidden \nPage 45\n\nit, Arya would gladly have taken the wolf with her to needlework. Let Septa Mordane complain about \nher stitches then. \nNymeria nipped eagerly at her hand as Arya untied her. She had yellow eyes. When they caught the \nsunlight, they gleamed like two golden coins. Arya had named her after the warrior queen of the Rhoyne, \nwho had led her people across the narrow sea. That had been a great scandal too. Sansa, of course, had \nnamed her pup \"Lady.\" Arya made a face and hugged the wolfling tight. Nymeria licked her ear, and she \ngiggled. \nBy now Septa Mordane would certainly have sent word to her lady mother. If she went to her room, \nthey would find her. Arya did not care to be found. She had a better notion. The boys were at practice in \nthe yard. She wanted to see Robb put gallant Prince Joffrey flat on his back. \"Come,\" she whispered to \nNymeria. She got up and ran, the wolf coming hard at her heels. \nThere was a window in the covered bridge between the armory and the Great Keep where you had a \nview of the whole yard. That was where they headed. \nThey arrived, flushed and breathless, to find Jon seated on the sill, one leg drawn up languidly to his chin. \nHe was watching the action, so absorbed that he seemed unaware of her approach until his white wolf \nmoved to meet them. Nymeria stalked closer on wary feet. Ghost, already larger than his litter mates, \nsmelled her, gave her ear a careful nip, and settled back down. \nJon gave her a curious look. \"Shouldn't you be working on your stitches, little sister?\" \nArya made a face at him. \"I wanted to see them fight.\" \nHe smiled. \"Come here, then.\" \nArya climbed up on the window and sat beside him, to a chorus of thuds and grunts from the yard \nbelow. \nTo her disappointment, it was the younger boys drilling. Bran was so heavily padded he looked as \nthough he had belted on a featherbed, and Prince Tommen, who was plump to begin with, seemed \npositively round. They were huffing and puffing and hitting at each other with padded wooden swords \nunder the watchful eye of old Ser Rodrik Cassel, the master-at-arms, a great stout keg of a man with \nmagnificent white cheek whiskers. A dozen spectators, man and boy, were calling out encouragement, \nRobb's voice the loudest among them. She spotted Theon Greyjoy beside him, his black doublet \nemblazoned with the golden kraken of his House, a look of wry contempt on his face. Both of the \ncombatants were staggering. Arya judged that they had been at it awhile. \n\"A shade more exhausting than needlework,\" Jon observed. \n\"A shade more fun than needlework,\" Arya gave back at him. Jon grinned, reached over, and messed up \nher hair. Arya flushed. They had always been close. Jon had their father's face, as she did. They were the \nonly ones. Robb and Sansa and Bran and even little Rickon all took after the Tullys, with easy smiles and \nfire in their hair. When Arya had been little, she had been afraid that meant that she was a bastard too. It \nbeen Jon she had gone to in her fear, and Jon who had reassured her. \n64 GEORGL R.R. MARTIN \n\"Why aren't you down in the yard?\" Arya asked him. \nPage 46\n\nHe gave her a half smile. \"Bastards are not allowed to damage young princes,\" he said. \"Any bruises \nthey take in the practice yard must come from trueborn swords.\" \n\"Oh.\" Arya felt abashed. She should have realized. For the second time today, Arya reflected that life \nwas not fair. \nShe watched her little brother whack at Tommen. \"I could do just as good as Bran,\" she said. \"He's only \nseven. I'm nine.\" \nJon looked her over with all his fourteen-year-old wisdom. \"You're too skinny,\" he said. He took her \narm to feel her muscle. Then he sighed and shook his head. \"I doubt you could even lift a longsword, little \nsister, never mind swing one.\" \nArya snatched back her arm and glared at him. Jon messed up her hair again. They watched Bran and \nTommen circle each other. \n\"You see Prince Joffrey?\" Jon asked. \nShe hadn't, not at first glance, but when she looked again she found him to the back, under the shade of \nthe high stone wall. He was surrounded by men she did not recognize, young squires in the livery of \nLannister and Baratheon, strangers all. There were a few older men among them; knights, she surmised. \n\"Look at the arms on his surcoat,\" Jon suggested. \nArya looked. An ornate shield had been embroidered on the prince's padded surcoat. No doubt the \nneedlework was exquisite. The arms were divided down the middle; on one side was the crowned stag \nof the royal House, on the other the lion of Lannister. \n\"The Lannisters are proud,\" Jon observed. \"You'd think the royal sigil would be sufficient, but no. He \nmakes his mother's House equal in honor to the king's.\" \n\"The woman is important too!\" Arya protested. \nJon chuckled. \"Perhaps you should do the same thing, little sister. Wed Tully to Stark in your arms.\" \n\"A wolf with a fish in its mouth?\" It made her laugh. \"That would look silly. Besides, if a girl can't fight, \nwhy should she have a coat of arms?\" \nJon shrugged. \"Girls get the arms but not the swords. Bastards get the swords but not the arms. I did not \nmake the rules, little sister.\" \nThere was a shout from the courtyard below. Prince Tommen was rolling in the dust, trying to get up and \nfailing. All the padding made him look like a turtle on its back. Bran was standing over him with upraised \nwooden sword, ready to whack him again once he regained his feet. The men began to laugh. \n\"Enough!\" Ser Rodrik called out. He gave the prince a hand and \nyanked him back to his feet. \"Well fought. Lew, Donnis, help them out of their armor.\" He looked \naround. \"Prince Joffrey, Robb, will you go another round?\" \nPage 47\n\nRobb, already sweaty from a previous bout, moved forward eagerly. \"Gladly.\" \nJoffrey moved into the sunlight in response to Rodrik's summons. His hair shone like spun gold. He \nlooked bored. \"This is a game for children, Ser Rodrik.\" \nTheon Greyjoy gave a sudden bark of laughter. \"You are children,\" he said derisively. \n\"Robb may be a child,\" Joffrey said. \"I am a prince. And I grow tired of swatting at Starks with a play \nsword.\" \n\"You got more swats than you gave, Joff,\" Robb said. \"Are you afraid?\" \nPrince Joffrey looked at him. \"Oh, terrified,\" he said. \"You're so much older.\" Some of the Lannister men \nlaughed. \nJon looked down on the scene with a frown. \"Joffrey is truly a little shit,\" he told Arya. \nSer Rodrik tugged thoughtfully at his white whiskers. \"What are you suggesting?\" he asked the prince. \n\"Live steel.\" \n\"Done,\" Robb shot back. \"You'll be sorry!\" \nThe master-at-arms put a hand on Robb's shoulder to quiet him. \"Live steel is too dangerous. I will \npermit you tourney swords, with blunted edges.\" \nJoffrey said nothing, but a man strange to Arya, a tall knight with black hair and burn scars on his face, \npushed forward in front of the prince. \"This is your prince. Who are you to tell him he may not have an \nedge on his sword, ser?\" \n\"Master-at-arms of Winterfell, Clegane, and you would do well not to forget it.\" \n\"Are you training women here?\" the burned man wanted to know. He was muscled like a bull. \n\"I am training knights,\" Ser Rodrik said pointedly. \"They will have steel when they are ready. When they \nare of an age.\" \nThe burned man looked at Robb. \"How old are you, boy?\" \n\"Fourteen,\" Robb said. \n\"I killed a man at twelve. You can be sure it was not with a blunt sword.\" \nArya could see Robb bristle. His pride was wounded. He turned on Ser Rodrik. \"Let me do it. I can \nbeat him.\" \n\"Beat him with a tourney blade, then,\" Ser Rodrik said. \nJoffrey shrugged. \"Come and see me when you're older, Stark. If you're not too old.\" There was \nlaughter from the Lannister men. \nPage 48\n\nRobb's curses rang through the yard. Arya covered her mouth in shock. Theon Greyjoy seized Robb's \narm to keep him away from the prince. Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers in dismay. \nJoffrey feigned a yawn and turned to his younger brother. \"Come, Tommen,\" he said. \"The hour of play \nis done. Leave the children to their frolics.\" \nThat brought more laughter from the Lannisters, more curses from Robb. Ser Rodrik's face was \nbeet-red with fury under the white of his whiskers. Theon kept Robb locked in an iron grip until the \nprinces and their party were safely away. \nJon watched them leave, and Arya watched Jon. His face had grown as still as the pool at the heart of \nthe godswood. Finally he climbed down off the window. \"The show is done,\" he said. He bent to scratch \nGhost behind the ears. The white wolf rose and rubbed against him. \"You had best run back to your \nroom, little sister. Septa Mordane will surely be lurking. The longer you hide, the sterner the penance. \nYou'll be sewing all through winter. When the spring thaw comes, they will find your body with a needle \nstill locked tight between your frozen fingers.\" \nArya didn't think it was funny. \"I hate needlework!\" she said with passion. \"It's not fair!\" \n\"Nothing is fair,\" Jon said. He messed up her hair again and walked away from her, Ghost moving \nsilently beside him. Nymeria started to follow too, then stopped and came back when she saw that Arya \nwas not coming. \nReluctantly she turned in the other direction. \nIt was worse than Jon had thought. It wasn't Septa Mordane waiting in her room. It was Septa Mordane \nand her mother. \nBRAN \nThe hunt left at dawn. The king wanted wild boar at the feast tonight. Prince Joffrey rode with his father, \nso Robb had been allowed to join the hunters as well. Uncle Benjen, Jory, Theon Greyjoy, Ser Rodrik, \nand even the queen's funny little brother had all ridden out with them. It was the last hunt, after all. On the \nmorrow they left for the south. \nBran had been left behind with Jon and the girls and Rickon. But Rickon was only a baby and the girls \nwere only girls and Jon and his wolf were nowhere to be found. Bran did not look for him very hard. He \nthought Jon was angry at him. Jon seemed to be angry at everyone these days. Bran did not know why. \nHe was going with Uncle Ben to the Wall, to join the Night's Watch. That was almost as good as going \nsouth with the king. Robb was the one they were leaving behind, not Jon. \nFor days, Bran could scarcely wait to be off. He was going to ride the kingsroad on a horse of his own, \nnot a pony but a real horse. His father would be the Hand of the King, and they were going to live in the \nred castle at King's Landing, the castle the Dragonlords had built. Old Nan said there were ghosts there, \nand dungeons where terrible things had been done, and dragon heads on the walls. It gave Bran a shiver \njust to think of it, but he was not afraid. How could he be afraid? \nHis father would be with him, and the king with all his knights and sworn swords. \nPage 49\n\nBran was going to be a knight himself someday, one of the Kingsguard. Old Nan said they were the \nfinest swords in all the realm. There were only seven of them, and they wore white armor and had no \nwives or children, but lived only to serve the king. Bran knew all the stories. Their names were like music \nto him. Serwyn of the Mirror Shield. Ser Ryam Redwyne. Prince Aemon the Dragonknight. The twins \nSer Erryk and Ser Arryk, who had died on one another's swords hundreds of years ago, when brother \nfought sister in the war the singers called the Dance of the Dragons. The White Bull, Gerold Hightower. \nSer Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. Barristan the Bold. \nTwo of the Kingsguard had come north with King Robert. Bran had watched them with fascination, \nnever quite daring to speak to them. Ser Boros was a bald man with a jowly face, and Ser Meryn had \ndroopy eyes and a beard the color of rust. Ser Jaime Lannister looked more like the knights in the \nstories, and he was of the Kingsguard too, but Robb said he had killed the old mad king and shouldn't \ncount anymore. The greatest living knight was Ser Barristan Selmy, Barristan the Bold, the Lord \nCommander of the Kingsguard. Father had promised that they would meet Ser Barristan when they \nreached King's Landing, and Bran had been marking the days on his wall, eager to depart, to see a world \nhe had only dreamed of and begin a life he could scarcely imagine. \nYet now that the last day was at hand, suddenly Bran felt lost. Winterfell had been the only home he had \never known. His father had told him that he ought to say his farewells today, and he had tried. After the \nhunt had ridden out, he wandered through the castle with his wolf at his side, intending to visit the ones \nwho would be left behind, Old Nan and Gage the cook, Mikken in his smithy, Hodor the stableboy who \nsmiled so much and took care of his pony and never said anything but \"Hodor,\" the man in the glass \ngardens who gave him a blackberry when he came to visit . . . \nBut it was no good. He had gone to the stable first, and seen his pony there in its stall, except it wasn't \nhis pony anymore, he was getting a real horse and leaving the pony behind, and all of a sudden Bran just \nwanted to sit down and cry. He turned and ran off before Hodor and the other stableboys could see the \ntears in his eyes. That was the end of his farewells. Instead Bran spent the morning alone in the \ngodswood, trying to teach his wolf to fetch a stick, and failing. The wolfling was smarter than any of the \nhounds in his father's kennel and Bran would \nhave sworn he understood every word that was said to him, but he showed very little interest in chasing \nsticks. \nHe was still trying to decide on a name. Robb was calling his Grey Wind, because he ran so fast. Sansa \nhad named hers Lady, and Arya named hers after some old witch queen in the songs, and little Rickon \ncalled his Shaggydog, which Bran thought was a pretty stupid name for a direwolf. Jon's wolf, the white \none, was Ghost. Bran wished he had thought of that first, even though his wolf wasn't white. He had tried \na hundred names in the last fortnight, but none of them sounded right. \nFinally he got tired of the stick game and decided to go climbing. He hadn't been up to the broken tower \nfor weeks with everything that had happened, and this might be his last chance. \nHe raced across the godswood, taking the long way around to avoid the pool where the heart tree grew. \nThe heart tree had always frightened him; trees ought not have eyes, Bran thought, or leaves that looked \nlike hands. His wolf came sprinting at his heels. \"You stay here,\" he told him at the base of the sentinel \ntree near the armory wall. \"Lie down. That's right. Now stay-\" \nThe wolf did as he was told. Bran scratched him behind the ears, then turned away, jumped, grabbed a \nlow branch, and pulled himself up. He was halfway up the tree, moving easily from limb to limb, when the \nwolf got to his feet and began to howl. \nPage 50"
