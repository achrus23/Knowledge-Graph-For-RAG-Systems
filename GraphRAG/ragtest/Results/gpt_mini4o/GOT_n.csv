Book One of A Song of Ice and Fire 
By George R. R. Martin 
PROLOGUE 
\""We should start back,\"" Gared urged as the woods began to grow dark around them. \""The wildlings are 
dead.\"" 
\""Do the dead frighten you?\"" Ser Waymar Royce asked with just the hint of a smile. 
Gared did not rise to the bait. He was an old man, past fifty, and he had seen the lordlings come and go. 
\""Dead is dead,\"" he said. \""We have no business with the dead.\"" 
\""Are they dead?\"" Royce asked softly. \""What proof have we?\"" 
\""Will saw them,\"" Gared said. \""If he says they are dead, that's proof enough for me.\"" 
Will had known they would drag him into the quarrel sooner or later. He wished it had been later rather 
than sooner. \""My mother told me that dead men sing no songs,\"" he put in. 
\""My wet nurse said the same thing, Will,\"" Royce replied. \""Never believe anything you hear at a woman's 
tit. There are things to be learned even from the dead.\"" His voice echoed, too loud in the twilit forest. 
Page 1

\""We have a long ride before us,\"" Gared pointed out. \""Eight days, maybe nine. And night is falling.\"" 
Ser Waymar Royce glanced at the sky with disinterest. \""It does that every day about this time. Are you 
unmanned by the dark, Gared?\"" 
Will could see the tightness around Gared's mouth, the barely sup 
pressed anger in his eyes under the thick black hood of his cloak. Gared had spent forty years in the 
Night's Watch, man and boy, and he was not accustomed to being made light of. Yet it was more than 
that. Under the wounded pride, Will could sense something else in the older man. You could taste it; a 
nervous tension that came perilous close to fear. 
Will shared his unease. He had been four years on the Wall. The first time he had been sent beyond, all 
the old stories had come rushing back, and his bowels had turned to water. He had laughed about it 
afterward. He was a veteran of a hundred rangings by now, and the endless dark wilderness that the 
southron called the haunted forest had no more terrors for him. 
Until tonight. Something was different tonight. There was an edge to this darkness that made his hackles 
rise. Nine days they had been riding, north and northwest and then north again, farther and farther from 
the Wall, hard on the track of a band of wildling raiders. Each day had been worse than the day that had 
come before it. Today was the worst of all. A cold wind was blowing out of the north, and it made the 
trees rustle like living things. All day, Will had felt as though something were watching him, something 
cold and implacable that loved him not. Gared had felt it too. Will wanted nothing so much as to ride 
hellbent for the safety of the Wall, but that was not a feeling to share with your commander. 
Especially not a commander like this one. 
Ser Waymar Royce was the youngest son of an ancient house with too many heirs. He was a handsome 
youth of eighteen, grey-eyed and graceful and slender as a knife. Mounted on his huge black destrier, the 
knight towered above Will and Gared on their smaller garrons. He wore black leather boots, black 
woolen pants, black moleskin gloves, and a fine supple coat of gleaming black ringmail over layers of 
black wool and boiled leather. Ser Waymar had been a Sworn Brother of the Night's Watch for less than 
half a year, but no one could say he had not prepared for his vocation. At least insofar as his wardrobe 
was concerned. 
His cloak was his crowning glory; sable, thick and black and soft as sin. \""Bet he killed them all himself, 
he did,\"" Gared told the barracks over wine, \""twisted their little heads off, our mighty warrior.\"" They had 
all shared the laugh. 
It is hard to take orders from a man you laughed at in your cups, Will reflected as he sat shivering atop 
his garron. Gared must have felt the same. 
\""Mormont said as we should track them, and we did,\"" Gared said. 
\""They're dead. They shan't trouble us no more. There's hard riding before us. I don't like this weather. If 
it snows, we could be a fortnight getting back, and snow's the best we can hope for. Ever seen an ice 
storm, my lord?\"" 
The lordling seemed not to hear him. He studied the deepening twilight in that half-bored, half-distracted 
Page 2

way he had. Will had ridden with the knight long enough to understand that it was best not to interrupt 
him when he looked like that. \""Tell me again what you saw, Will. All the details. Leave nothing out.\"" 
Will had been a hunter before he joined the Night's Watch. Well, a poacher in truth. Mallister freeriders 
had caught him red-handed in the Mallisters' own woods, skinning one of the Mallisters' own bucks, and 
it had been a choice of putting on the black or losing a hand. No one could move through the woods as 
silent as Will, and it had not taken the black brothers long to discover his talent. 
\""The})"
"(:__Chunk__ {n_tokens: 1200,id: ed94fbb704c4b08f3f33c3296bc6d211,text:  out.\"" 
Will had been a hunter before he joined the Night's Watch. Well, a poacher in truth. Mallister freeriders 
had caught him red-handed in the Mallisters' own woods, skinning one of the Mallisters' own bucks, and 
it had been a choice of putting on the black or losing a hand. No one could move through the woods as 
silent as Will, and it had not taken the black brothers long to discover his talent. 
\""The camp is two miles farther on, over that ridge, hard beside a stream,\"" Will said. \""I got close as I 
dared. There's eight of them, men and women both. No children I could see. They put up a lean-to 
against the rock. The snow's pretty well covered it now, but I could still make it out. No fire burning, but 
the firepit was still plain as day. No one moving. I watched a long time. No living man ever lay so still.\"" 
\""Did you see any blood?\"" 
\""Well, no,\"" Will admitted. 
\""Did you see any weapons?\"" 
\""Some swords, a few bows. One man had an axe. Heavy-looking, double-bladed, a cruel piece of iron. 
It was on the ground beside him, right by his hand.\"" 
\""Did you make note of the position of the bodies?\"" 
Will shrugged. \""A couple are sitting up against the rock. Most of them on the ground. Fallen, like.\"" 
\""Or sleeping,\"" Royce suggested. 
\""Fallen,\"" Will insisted. \""There's one woman up an ironwood, halfhid in the branches. A far-eyes.\"" He 
smiled thinly. \""I took care she never saw me. When I got closer, I saw that she wasn't moving neither.\"" 
Despite himself, he shivered. 
\""You have a chill?\"" Royce asked. 
\""Some,\"" Will muttered. \""The wind, m'lord.\"" 
The young knight turned back to his grizzled man-at-arms. Frostfallen leaves whispered past them, and 
Royce's destrier moved restlessly. \""What do you think might have killed these men, Gared?\"" Ser 
Waymar asked casually. He adjusted the drape of his long sable cloak. 
\""It was the cold,\"" Gared said with iron certainty. \""I saw men freeze 
last winter, and the one before, when I was half a boy. Everyone talks about snows forty foot deep, and 
how the ice wind comes howling out of the north, but the real enemy is the cold. It steals up on you 
quieter than Will, and at first you shiver and your teeth chatter and you stamp your feet and dream of 
mulled wine and nice hot fires. It burns, it does. Nothing burns like the cold. But only for a while. Then it 
gets inside you and starts to fill you up, and after a while you don't have the strength to fight it. It's easier 
just to sit down or go to sleep. They say you don't feel any pain toward the end. First you go weak and 
drowsy, and everything starts to fade, and then it's like sinking into a sea of warm milk. Peaceful, like.\"" 
\""Such eloquence, Gared,\"" Ser Waymar observed. \""I never suspected you had it in you.\"" 
Page 3

\""I've had the cold in me too, lordling.\"" Gared pulled back his hood, giving Ser Waymar a good long look 
at the stumps where his ears had been. \""Two ears, three toes, and the little finger off my left hand. I got 
off light. We found my brother frozen at his watch, with a smile on his face.\"" 
Ser Waymar shrugged. \""You ought dress more warmly, Gared.\"" 
Gared glared at the lordling, the scars around his ear holes flushed red with anger where Maester 
Aemon had cut the ears away. \""We'll see how warm you can dress when the winter comes.\"" He pulled 
up his hood and hunched over his garron, silent and sullen. 
\""If Gared said it was the cold . . .\"" Will began. 
\""Have you drawn any watches this past week, Will?\"" 
\""Yes, m'lord.\"" There never was a week when he did not draw a dozen bloody watches. What was the 
man driving at? 
\""And how did you find the Wall?\"" 
\""Weeping,\"" Will said, frowning. He saw it clear enough, now that the lordling had pointed it out. \""They 
couldn't have froze. Not if the Wall was weeping. It wasn't cold enough.\"" 
Royce nodded. \""Bright lad. We've had a few light frosts this past week, and a quick flurry of snow now 
and then, but surely no cold fierce enough to kill eight grown men. Men clad in fur and leather, let me 
remind you, with shelter near at hand, and the means of making fire.\"" The knight's smile was cocksure. 
\""Will, lead us there. I would see these dead men for myself.\"" 
And then there was nothing to be done for it. The order had been given, and honor bound them to obey. 
Will went in front, his shaggy little garron picking the way carefully through the undergrowth. A light 
snow had fallen the night before, and there were stones and roots and hidden sinks lying just under its 
crust, waiting for the careless and the unwary. Ser Waymar Royce came next, his great black destrier 
snorting impatiently. The warhorse was the wrong mount for ranging, but try and tell that})"
"(:__Chunk__ {n_tokens: 1200,id: 88280085eb9a17c4f5a157672f321703,text:  and honor bound them to obey. 
Will went in front, his shaggy little garron picking the way carefully through the undergrowth. A light 
snow had fallen the night before, and there were stones and roots and hidden sinks lying just under its 
crust, waiting for the careless and the unwary. Ser Waymar Royce came next, his great black destrier 
snorting impatiently. The warhorse was the wrong mount for ranging, but try and tell that to the lordling. 
Gared brought up the rear. The old man-at-arms muttered to himself as he rode. 
Twilight deepened. The cloudless sky turned a deep purple, the color of an old bruise, then faded to 
black. The stars began to come out. A half-moon rose. Will was grateful for the light. 
\""We can make a better pace than this, surely,\"" Royce said when the moon was full risen. 
\""Not with this horse,\"" Will said. Fear had made him insolent. \""Perhaps my lord would care to take the 
lead?\"" 
Ser Waymar Royce did not deign to reply. 
Somewhere off in the wood a wolf howled. 
Will pulled his garron over beneath an ancient gnarled ironwood and dismounted. 
Page 4

\""Why are you stopping?\"" Ser Waymar asked. 
\""Best go the rest of the way on foot, m'lord. It's just over that ridge.\"" 
Royce paused a moment, staring off into the distance, his face reflective. A cold wind whispered through 
the trees. His great sable cloak stirred behind like something half-alive. 
\""There's something wrong here,\"" Gared muttered. 
The young knight gave him a disdainful smile. \""Is there?\"" 
\""Can't you feel it?\"" Gared asked. \""Listen to the darkness.\"" 
Will could feel it. Four years in the Night's Watch, and he had never been so afraid. What was it? 
\""Wind. Trees rustling. A wolf. Which sound is it that unmans you so, Gared?\"" When Gared did not 
answer, Royce slid gracefully from his saddle. He tied the destrier securely to a low-hanging limb, well 
away from the other horses, and drew his longsword from its sheath. Jewels glittered in its hilt, and the 
moonlight ran down the shining steel. It was a splendid weapon, castle-forged, and new-made from the 
look of it. Will doubted it had ever been swung in anger. 
\""The trees press close here,\"" Will warned. \""That sword will tangle you up, m1ord. Better a knife.\"" 
\""If I need instruction, I will ask for it,\"" the young lord said. \""Gared, stay here. Guard the horses.\"" 
Gared dismounted. \""We need a fire. I'll see to it.\"" 
\""How big a fool are you, old man? If there are enemies in this wood, a fire is the last thing we want.\"" 
\""There's some enemies a fire will keep away,\"" Gared said. \""Bears and direwolves and ... and other 
things . . .\"" 
Ser Waymar's mouth became a hard line. \""No fire.\"" 
Gared's hood shadowed his face, but Will could see the hard glitter in his eyes as he stared at the knight. 
For a moment he was afraid the older man would go for his sword. It was a short, ugly thing, its grip 
discolored by sweat, its edge nicked from hard use, but Will would not have given an iron bob for the 
lordling's life if Gared pulled it from its scabbard. 
Finally Gared looked down. \""No fire,\"" he muttered, low under his breath. 
Royce took it for acquiescence and turned away. \""Lead on,\"" he said to Will. 
Will threaded their way through a thicket, then started up the slope to the low ridge where he had found 
his vantage point under a sentinel tree. Under the thin crust of snow, the ground was damp and muddy, 
slick footing, with rocks and hidden roots to trip you up. Will made no sound as he climbed. Behind him, 
he heard the soft metallic slither of the lordling's ringmail, the rustle of leaves, and muttered curses as 
reaching branches grabbed at his longsword and tugged on his splendid sable cloak. 
The great sentinel was right there at the top of the ridge, where Will had known it would be, its lowest 
branches a bare foot off the ground. Will slid in underneath, flat on his belly in the snow and the mud, and 
Page 5

looked down on the empty clearing below. 
His heart stopped in his chest. For a moment he dared not breathe. Moonlight shone down on the 
clearing, the ashes of the firepit, the snow-covered lean-to, the great rock, the little half-frozen stream. 
Everything was just as it had been a few hours ago. 
They were gone. All the bodies were gone. 
\""Gods!\"" he heard behind him. A sword slashed at a branch as Ser Waymar Royce gained the ridge. He 
stood there beside the sentinel, longsword in hand, his cloak billowing behind him as the wind came up, 
outlined nobly against the stars for all to see. 
\""Get down!\"" Will whispered urgently. \""Something's wrong.\"" 
Royce did not move. He looked down at the empty clearing and laughed. \""Your dead men seem to have 
moved camp, Will.\"" 
Will's voice abandoned him. He groped for words that did not})"

stood there beside the sentinel, longsword in hand, his cloak billowing behind him as the wind came up, 
outlined nobly against the stars for all to see. 
\""Get down!\"" Will whispered urgently. \""Something's wrong.\"" 
Royce did not move. He looked down at the empty clearing and laughed. \""Your dead men seem to have 
moved camp, Will.\"" 
Will's voice abandoned him. He groped for words that did not come. It was not possible. His eyes 
swept back and forth over the abandoned campsite, stopped on the axe. A huge double-bladed 
battle-axe, still lying where he had seen it last, untouched. A valuable weapon . . . 
\""On your feet, Will,\"" Ser Waymar commanded. \""There's no one here. I won't have you hiding under a 
bush.\"" 
Reluctantly, Will obeyed. 
Ser Waymar looked him over with open disapproval. \""I am not going back to Castle Black a failure on 
my first ranging. We will find these men.\"" He glanced around. \""Up the tree. Be quick about it. Look for a 
fire.\"" 
Will turned away, wordless. There was no use to argue. The wind was moving. It cut right through him. 
He went to the tree, a vaulting grey-green sentinel, and began to climb. Soon his hands were sticky with 
sap, and he was lost among the needles. Fear filled his gut like a meal he could not digest. He whispered 
a prayer to the nameless gods of the wood, and slipped his dirk free of its sheath. He put it between his 
teeth to keep both hands free for climbing. The taste of cold iron in his mouth gave him comfort. 
Down below, the lordling called out suddenly, \""Who goes there?\"" Will heard uncertainty in the challenge. 
He stopped climbing; he listened; he watched. 
The woods gave answer: the rustle of leaves, the icy rush of the stream, a distant hoot of a snow owl. 
The Others made no sound. 
Will saw movement from the corner of his eye. Pale shapes gliding through the wood. He turned his 
head, glimpsed a white shadow in the darkness. Then it was gone. Branches stirred gently in the wind, 
scratching at one another with wooden fingers. Will opened his mouth to call down a warning, and the 
words seemed to freeze in his throat. Perhaps he was wrong. Perhaps it had only been a bird, a reflection 
on the snow, some trick of the moonlight. What had he seen, after all? 
\""Will, where are you?\"" Ser Waymar called up. \""Can you see anything?\"" He was turning in a slow circle, 
suddenly wary, his sword in hand. He must have felt them, as Will felt them. There was nothing to see. 
Page 6

\""Answer me! Why is it so cold?\"" 
It was cold. Shivering, Will clung more tightly to his perch. His face pressed hard against the trunk of the 
sentinel. He could feel the sweet, sticky sap on his cheek. 
A shadow emerged from the dark of the wood. It stood in front of Royce. Tall, it was, and gaunt and 
hard as old bones, with flesh pale as milk. Its armor seemed to change color as it moved; here it was 
white as new-fallen snow, there black as shadow, everywhere dappled with the deep grey-green of the 
trees. The patterns ran like moonlight on water with every step it took. 
Will heard the breath go out of Ser Waymar Royce in a long hiss. 
\""Come no farther,\"" the lordling warned. His voice cracked like a boy's. He threw the long sable cloak 
back over his shoulders, to free his arms for battle, and took his sword in both hands. The wind had 
stopped. It was very cold. 
The Other slid forward on silent feet. In its hand was a longsword like none that Will had ever seen. No 
human metal had gone into the forging of that blade. It was alive with moonlight, translucent, a shard of 
crystal so thin that it seemed almost to vanish when seen edge-on. There was a faint blue shimmer to the 
thing, a ghost-light that played around its edges, and somehow Will knew it was sharper than any razor. 
Ser Waymar met him bravely. \""Dance with me then.\"" He lifted his sword high over his head, defiant. His 
hands trembled from the weight of it, or perhaps from the cold. Yet in that moment, Will thought, he was 
a boy no longer, but a man of the Night's Watch. 
The Other halted. Will saw its eyes; blue, deeper and bluer than any human eyes, a blue that burned like 
ice. They fixed on the longsword trembling on high, watched the moonlight running cold along the metal. 
For a heartbeat he dared to hope. 
They emerged silently from the shadows, twins to the first. Three of them . . . four . . . five . . . Ser 
Waymar may have felt the cold that came with them, but he never saw them, never heard them. Will had 
to call out. It was his duty. And his death, if he did. He shivered, and hugged the tree, and kept the 
silence. 
The pale sword came shivering through the air. 
Ser Waymar met it with steel. When the blades met, there was no ring of metal on metal; only a high, 
thin sound at the edge of hearing, like an})"
"(:__Chunk__ {n_tokens: 1200,id: 23d11b3736841cb8654f23d05f0aa3d1,text:  that came with them, but he never saw them, never heard them. Will had 
to call out. It was his duty. And his death, if he did. He shivered, and hugged the tree, and kept the 
silence. 
The pale sword came shivering through the air. 
Ser Waymar met it with steel. When the blades met, there was no ring of metal on metal; only a high, 
thin sound at the edge of hearing, like an animal screaming in pain. Royce checked a second blow, and a 
third, then fell back a step. Another flurry of blows, and he fell back again. 
Behind him, to right, to left, all around him, the watchers stood patient, faceless, silent, the shifting 
patterns of their delicate armor making them all but invisible in the wood. Yet they made no move to 
interfere. 
Again and again the swords met, until Will wanted to cover his ears against the strange anguished 
keening of their clash. Ser Waymar was panting from the effort now, his breath steaming in the moonlight. 
His blade was white with frost; the Other's danced with pale blue light. 
Then Royce's parry came a beat too late. The pale sword bit through the ringmail beneath his arm. The 
young lord cried out in pain. Blood welled between the rings. It steamed in the cold, and the droplets 
seemed red as fire where they touched the snow. Ser 
Page 7

Waymar's fingers brushed his side. His moleskin glove came away soaked with red. 
The Other said something in a language that Will did not know; his voice was like the cracking of ice on 
a winter lake, and the words were mocking. 
Ser Waymar Royce found his fury. \""For Robert!\"" he shouted, and he came up snarling, lifting the 
frost-covered longsword with both hands and swinging it around in a flat sidearm slash with all his weight 
behind it. The Other's parry was almost lazy. 
When the blades touched, the steel shattered. 
A scream echoed through the forest night, and the longsword shivered into a hundred brittle pieces, the 
shards scattering like a rain of needles. Royce went to his knees, shrieking, and covered his eyes. Blood 
welled between his fingers. 
The watchers moved forward together, as if some signal had been given. Swords rose and fell, all in a 
deathly silence. It was cold butchery. The pale blades sliced through ringmail as if it were silk. Will closed 
his eyes. Far beneath him, he heard their voices and laughter sharp as icicles. 
When he found the courage to look again, a long time had passed, and the ridge below was empty. 
He stayed in the tree, scarce daring to breathe, while the moon crept slowly across the black sky. 
Finally, his muscles cramping and his fingers numb with cold, he climbed down. 
Royce's body lay facedown in the snow, one arm outflung. The thick sable cloak had been slashed in a 
dozen places. Lying dead like that, you saw how young he was. A boy. 
He found what was left of the sword a few feet away, the end splintered and twisted like a tree struck 
by lightning. Will knelt, looked around warily, and snatched it up. The broken sword would be his proof. 
Gared would know what to make of it, and if not him, then surely that old bear Mormont or Maester 
Aemon. Would Gared still be waiting with the horses? He had to hurry. 
Will rose. Ser Waymar Royce stood over him. 
His fine clothes were a tatter, his face a ruin. A shard from his sword transfixed the blind white pupil of 
his left eye. 
The right eye was open. The pupil burned blue. It saw. 
The broken sword fell from nerveless fingers. Will closed his eyes to pray. Long, elegant hands brushed 
his cheek, then tightened around his throat. They were gloved in the finest moleskin and sticky with 
blood, yet the touch was icy cold. 
BRAN 
The morning had dawned clear and cold, with a crispness that hinted at the end of summer. They set 
forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded, twenty in all, and Bran rode among them, nervous with 
excitement. This was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord father and his 
Page 8

brothers to see the king's justice done. It was the ninth year of summer, and the seventh of Bran's life. 
The man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills. Robb thought he was a wildling, his sword 
sworn to Mance Rayder, the Kingbeyond-the-Wall. It made Bran's skin prickle to think of it. He 
remembered the hearth tales Old Nan told them. The wildlings were cruel men, she said, slavers and 
slayers and thieves. They consorted with giants and ghouls, stole girl children in the dead of night, and 
drank blood from polished horns. And their women lay with the Others in the Long Night to sire terrible 
half-human children. 
But the man they found bound hand and foot to the holdfast wall awaiting the king's justice was old and 
scrawny, not much taller than Robb. He had lost both ears and a finger to frostbite, and he dressed all in 
black, the same as a brother of the Night's})"
"(:__Chunk__ {n_tokens: 1200,id: b8ca812efe1e1e40c9a31e495c805758,text:  girl children in the dead of night, and 
drank blood from polished horns. And their women lay with the Others in the Long Night to sire terrible 
half-human children. 
But the man they found bound hand and foot to the holdfast wall awaiting the king's justice was old and 
scrawny, not much taller than Robb. He had lost both ears and a finger to frostbite, and he dressed all in 
black, the same as a brother of the Night's Watch, except that his furs were ragged and greasy. 
The breath of man and horse mingled, steaming, in the cold morning air as his lord father had the man cut 
down from the wall and 
dragged before them. Robb and Jon sat tall and still on their horses, with Bran between them on his 
pony, trying to seem older than seven, trying to pretend that he'd seen all this before. A faint wind blew 
through the holdfast gate. Over their heads flapped the banner of the Starks of Winterfell: a grey direwolf 
racing across an ice-white field. 
Bran's father sat solemnly on his horse, long brown hair stirring in the wind. His closely trimmed beard 
was shot with white, making him look older than his thirty-five years. He had a grim cast to his grey eyes 
this day, and he seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of 
the age of heroes and the children of the forest. He had taken off Father's face, Bran thought, and 
donned the face of Lord Stark of Winterfell. 
There were questions asked and answers given there in the chill of morning, but afterward Bran could 
not recall much of what had been said. Finally his lord father gave a command, and two of his guardsmen 
dragged the ragged man to the ironwood stump in the center of the square. They forced his head down 
onto the hard black wood. Lord Eddard Stark dismounted and his ward Theon Greyjoy brought forth 
the sword. \""Ice,\"" that sword was called. It was as wide across as a man's hand, and taller even than 
Robb. The blade was Valyrian steel, spell-forged and dark as smoke. Nothing held an edge like Valyrian 
steel. 
His father peeled off his gloves and handed them to Jory Cassel, the captain of his household guard. He 
took hold of Ice with both hands and said, \""In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of 
his Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and 
Protector of the Realm, by the word of Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of 
the North, I do sentence you to die.\"" He lifted the greatsword high above his head. 
Bran's bastard brother Jon Snow moved closer. \""Keep the pony well in hand,\"" he whispered. \""And 
don't look away. Father will know if you do.\"" 
Bran kept his pony well in hand, and did not look away. 
His father took off the man's head with a single sure stroke. Blood sprayed out across the snow, as red 
as surnmerwine. One of the horses reared and had to be restrained to keep from bolting. Bran could not 
take his eyes off the blood. The snows around the stump drank it eagerly, reddening as he watched. 
The head bounced off a thick root and rolled. It came up near Greyjoy's feet. Theon was a lean, dark 
Page 9

youth of nineteen who found 
everything amusing. He laughed, put his boot on the head, and kicked it away. 
\""Ass,\"" Jon muttered, low enough so Greyjoy did not hear. He put a hand on Bran's shoulder, and Bran 
looked over at his bastard brother. \""You did well,\"" Jon told him solemnly. Jon was fourteen, an old hand 
at justice. 
It seemed colder on the long ride back to Winterfell, though the wind had died by then and the sun was 
higher in the sky. Bran rode with his brothers, well ahead of the main party, his pony struggling hard to 
keep up with their horses. 
\""The deserter died bravely,\"" Robb said. He was big and broad and growing every day, with his mother's 
coloring, the fair skin, red-brown hair, and blue eyes of the Tullys of Riverrun. \""He had courage, at the 
least.\"" 
\""No,\"" Jon Snow said quietly. \""It was not courage. This one was dead of fear. You could see it in his 
eyes, Stark.\"" Jon's eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black, but there was little they did not 
see. He was of an age with Robb, but they did not look alike. Jon was slender where Robb was 
muscular, dark where Robb was fair, graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast. 
Robb was not impressed. \""The Others take his eyes,\"" he swore. \""He died well. Race you to the bridge?\"" 
\""Done,\"" Jon said, kicking his horse forward. Robb cursed and followed, and they galloped off down the 
trail, Robb laughing and hooting, Jon silent and intent. The hooves of their horses kicked up showers of 
snow as they went.

thinking of them now. After a while})"

\""Done,\"" Jon said, kicking his horse forward. Robb cursed and followed, and they galloped off down the 
trail, Robb laughing and hooting, Jon silent and intent. The hooves of their horses kicked up showers of 
snow as they went. 
Bran did not try to follow. His pony could not keep up. He had seen the ragged man's eyes, and he was 
thinking of them now. After a while, the sound of Robb's laughter receded, and the woods grew silent 
again. 
So deep in thought was he that he never heard the rest of the party until his father moved up to ride 
beside him. \""Are you well, Bran?\"" he asked, not unkindly. 
\""Yes, Father,\"" Bran told him. He looked up. Wrapped in his furs and leathers, mounted on his great 
warhorse, his lord father loomed over him like a giant. \""Robb says the man died bravely, but Jon says he 
was afraid.\"" 
\""What do you think?\"" his father asked. 
Bran thought about it. \""Can a man still be brave if he's afraid?\"" 
\""That is the only time a man can be brave,\"" his father told him. \""Do you understand why I did it?\"" 
\""He was a wildling,\"" Bran said. \""They carry off women and sell them to the Others.\"" 
His lord father smiled. \""Old Nan has been telling you stories again. In truth, the man was an oathbreaker, 
a deserter from the Night's Watch. No man is more dangerous. The deserter knows his life is forfeit if he 
is taken, so he will not flinch from any crime, no matter how vile. But you mistake me. The question was 
not why the man had to die, but why I must do it.\"" 
Page 10

Bran had no answer for that. \""King Robert has a headsman,\"" he said, uncertainly. 
\""He does,\"" his father admitted. \""As did the Targaryen kings before him. Yet our way is the older way. 
The blood of the First Men still flows in the veins of the Starks, and we hold to the belief that the man 
who passes the sentence should swing the sword. If you would take a man's life, you owe it to him to 
look into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does 
not deserve to die. 
\""One day, Bran, you will be Robb's bannerman, holding a keep of your own for your brother and your 
king, and justice will fall to you. When that day comes, you must take no pleasure in the task, but neither 
must you look away. A ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is.\"" 
That was when Jon reappeared on the crest of the hill before them. He waved and shouted down at 
them. \""Father, Bran, come quickly, see what Robb has found!\"" Then he was gone again. 
Jory rode up beside them. \""Trouble, my lord?\"" 
\""Beyond a doubt,\"" his lord father said. \""Come, let us see what mischief my sons have rooted out now.\"" 
He sent his horse into a trot. Jory and Bran and the rest came after. 
They found Robb on the riverbank north of the bridge, with Jon still mounted beside him. The late 
summer snows had been heavy this moonturn. Robb stood knee-deep in white, his hood pulled back so 
the sun shone in his hair. He was cradling something in his arm, while the boys talked in hushed, excited 
voices. 
The riders picked their way carefully through the drifts, groping for solid footing on the hidden, uneven 
ground. Jory Cassel and Theon Greyjoy were the first to reach the boys. Greyjoy was laughing and 
joking as he rode. Bran heard the breath go out of him. \""Gods!\"" he exclaimed, struggling to keep control 
of his horse as he reached for his sword. 
Jory's sword was already out. \""Robb, get away from it!\"" he called as his horse reared under him. 
Robb grinned and looked up from the bundle in his arms. \""She can't hurt you,\"" he said. \""She's dead, 
Jory.\"" 
Bran was afire with curiosity by then. He would have spurred the pony faster, but his father made them 
dismount beside the bridge and approach on foot. Bran jumped off and ran. 
By then Jon, Jory, and Theon Greyjoy had all dismounted as well. \""What in the seven hells is it?\"" 
Greyjoy was saying. 
\""A wolf,\"" Robb told him. 
\""A freak,\"" Greyjoy said. \""Look at the size of it.\"" 
Bran's heart was thumping in his chest as he pushed through a waist-high drift to his brothers' side. 
Half-buried in bloodstained snow, a huge dark shape slumped in death. Ice had formed in its shaggy 
grey fur, and the faint smell of corruption clung to it like a woman's perfume. Bran glimpsed blind eyes 
crawling with maggots, a wide mouth full of yellowed teeth. But it was the size of it that made him gasp. It 
was bigger than his pony, twice the size of the largest hound in his father's kennel. 
Page 11

\""It's no freak,\"" Jon said calmly. \""That's a direwolf. They grow larger than the other kind.\"" 
})"
"(:__Chunk__ {n_tokens: 1200,id: 6673e39704407acfaefd8f1df4510235,text:  of corruption clung to it like a woman's perfume. Bran glimpsed blind eyes 
crawling with maggots, a wide mouth full of yellowed teeth. But it was the size of it that made him gasp. It

Page 11

\""It's no freak,\"" Jon said calmly. \""That's a direwolf. They grow larger than the other kind.\"" 
Theon Greyjoy said, \""There's not been a direwolf sighted south of the Wall in two hundred years.\"" 
\""I see one now,\"" Jon replied. 
Bran tore his eyes away from the monster. That was when he noticed the bundle in Robb's arms. He 
gave a cry of delight and moved closer. The pup was a tiny ball of grey-black fur, its eyes still closed. It 
nuzzled blindly against Robb's chest as he cradled it, searching for milk among his leathers, making a sad 
little whimpery sound. Bran reached out hesitantly. \""Go on,\"" Robb told him. \""You can touch him.\"" 
Bran gave the pup a quick nervous stroke, then turned as Jon said, \""Here you go.\"" His half brother put a 
second pup into his arms. \""There are five of them.\"" Bran sat down in the snow and hugged the wolf pup 
to his face. Its fur was soft and warm against his cheek. 
\""Direwolves loose in the realm, after so many years,\"" muttered Hullen, the master of horse. \""I like it not.\"" 
\""It is a sign,\"" Jory said. 
Father frowned. \""This is only a dead animal, Jory,\"" he said. Yet he seemed troubled. Snow crunched 
under his boots as he moved around the body. \""Do we know what killed her?\"" 
\""There's something in the throat,\"" Robb told him, proud to have found the answer before his father even 
asked. \""There, just under the jaw.,, 
His father knelt and groped under the beast's head with his hand. 
He gave a yank and held it up for all to see. A foot of shattered antler, tines snapped off, all wet with 
blood. 
A sudden silence descended over the party. The men looked at the antler uneasily, and no one dared to 
speak. Even Bran could sense their fear, though he did not understand. 
His father tossed the antler to the side and cleansed his hands in the snow. \""I'm surprised she lived long 
enough to whelp,\"" he said. His voice broke the spell. 
\""Maybe she didn't,\"" Jory said. \""I've heard tales . . . maybe the bitch was already dead when the pups 
came.\"" 
\""Born with the dead,\"" another man put in. \""Worse luck.\"" 
\""No matter,\"" said Hullen. \""They be dead soon enough too.\"" 
Bran gave a wordless cry of dismay. 
\""The sooner the better,\"" Theon Greyjoy agreed. He drew his sword. \""Give the beast here, Bran.\"" 
The little thing squirmed against him, as if it heard and understood. \""No!\"" Bran cried out fiercely. \""It's 
mine.\"" 
Page 12

\""Put away your sword, Greyjoy,\"" Robb said. For a moment he sounded as commanding as their father, 
like the lord he would someday be. \""We will keep these pups.\"" 
\""You cannot do that, boy,\"" said Harwin, who was Hullen's son. 
\""It be a mercy to kill them,\"" Hullen said. 
Bran looked to his lord father for rescue, but got only a frown, a furrowed brow. \""Hullen speaks truly, 
son. Better a swift death than a hard one from cold and starvation.\"" 
\""No!\"" He could feel tears welling in his eyes, and he looked away. He did not want to cry in front of his 
father. 
Robb resisted stubbornly. \""Ser Rodrik's red bitch whelped again last week,\"" he said. \""It was a small 
litter, only two live pups. She'll have milk enough.\"" 
\""She'll rip them apart when they try to nurse.\"" 
\""Lord Stark,\"" Jon said. It was strange to hear him call Father that, so formal. Bran looked at him with 
desperate hope. \""There are five pups,\"" he told Father. \""Three male, two female.\"" 
\""What of it, Jon?\"" 
\""You have five trueborn children,\"" Jon said. \""Three sons, two daughters. The direwolf is the sigil of your 
House. Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord.\"" 
Bran saw his father's face change, saw the other men exchange glances. He loved Jon with all his heart 
at that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count had come right 
only because Jon had omitted himself. He had included the girls, 
included even Rickon, the baby, but not the bastard who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom 
decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own. 
Their father understood as well. \""You want no pup for yourself, Jon?\"" he asked softly. 
\""The direwolf graces the banners of House Stark,\"" Jon pointed out. \""I am no Stark, Father.\"" 
Their lord father regarded Jon thoughtfully. Robb rushed into the silence he left. \""I will nurse him myself, 
Father,\"" he promised. \""I will soak a towel with warm milk, and give him suck from})"
"(:__Chunk__ {n_tokens: 1200,id: c8f29bdd6be814db059a2e1cc2561617,text:  be born with no name of their own. 
Their father understood as well. \""You want no pup for yourself, Jon?\"" he asked softly. 
\""The direwolf graces the banners of House Stark,\"" Jon pointed out. \""I am no Stark, Father.\"" 
Their lord father regarded Jon thoughtfully. Robb rushed into the silence he left. \""I will nurse him myself, 
Father,\"" he promised. \""I will soak a towel with warm milk, and give him suck from that.\"" 
\""Me too!\"" Bran echoed. 
The lord weighed his sons long and carefully with his eyes. \""Easy to say, and harder to do. I will not 
have you wasting the servants' time with this. If you want these pups, you will feed them yourselves. Is 
that understood?\"" 
Bran nodded eagerly. The pup squirmed in his grasp, licked at his face with a warm tongue. 
\""You must train them as well,\"" their father said. \""You must train them. The kennelmaster will have nothing 
to do with these monsters, I promise you that. And the gods help you if you neglect them, or brutalize 
them, or train them badly. These are not dogs to beg for treats and slink off at a kick. A direwolf will rip 
Page 13

a man's arm off his shoulder as easily as a dog will kill a rat. Are you sure you want this?\"" 
\""Yes, Father,\"" Bran said. 
\""Yes,\"" Robb agreed. 
\""The pups may die anyway, despite all you do.\"" 
\""They won't die,\"" Robb said. \""We won't let them die.\"" 
\""Keep them, then. Jory, Desmond, gather up the other pups. It's time we were back to Winterfell.\"" 
It was not until they were mounted and on their way that Bran allowed himself to taste the sweet air of 
victory. By then, his pup was snuggled inside his leathers, warm against him, safe for the long ride home. 
Bran was wondering what to name him. 
Halfway across the bridge, Jon pulled up suddenly. 
\""What is it, Jon?\"" their lord father asked. 
\""Can't you hear it?\"" 
Bran could hear the wind in the trees, the clatter of their hooves on the ironwood planks, the whimpering 
of his hungry pup, but Jon was listening to something else. 
\""There,\"" Jon said. He swung his horse around and galloped back across the bridge. They watched him 
dismount where the direwolf lay 
dead in the snow, watched him kneel. A moment later he was riding back to them, smiling. 
\""He must have crawled away from the others,\"" Jon said. 
\""Or been driven away,\"" their father said, looking at the sixth pup. His fur was white, where the rest of the 
litter was grey. His eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning. Bran 
thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind. 
\""An albino,\"" Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement. \""This one will die even faster than the others.\"" 
Jon Snow gave his father's ward a long, chilling look. \""I think not, Greyjoy,\"" he said. \""This one belongs 
to me.\"" 
CATELYN 
Catelyn had never liked this godswood. 
She had been born a Tully, at Riverrun far to the south, on the Red Fork of the Trident. The godswood 
there was a garden, bright and airy, where tall redwoods spread dappled shadows across tinkling 
streams, birds sang from hidden nests, and the air was spicy with the scent of flowers. 
Page 14

The gods of Winterfell kept a different sort of wood. It was a dark, primal place, three acres of old 
forest untouched for ten thousand years as the gloomy castle rose around it. It smelled of moist earth and 
decay. No redwoods grew here. This was a wood of stubborn sentinel trees armored in grey-green 
needles, of mighty oaks, of ironwoods as old as the realm itself. Here thick black trunks crowded close 
together while twisted branches wove a dense canopy overhead and misshappen roots wrestled beneath 
the soil. This was a place of deep silence and brooding shadows, and the gods who lived here had no 
names. 
But she knew she would find her husband here tonight. Whenever he took a man's life, afterward he 
would seek the quiet of the godswood. 
Catelyn had been anointed with the seven oils and named in the rainbow of light that filled the sept of 
Riverrun. She was of the Faith, like her father and grandfather and his father before him. Her gods had 
names, and their faces were as familiar as the faces of her parents. 
Worship was a septon with a censer, the smell of incense, a seven-sided crystal alive with light, voices 
raised in song. The Tullys kept a godswood, as all the great houses did, but it was only a place to walk 
or read or lie in the sun. Worship was for the sept. 
For her sake, Ned had built a small sept where she might sing to the seven faces of god, but the blood of 
the First Men still flowed in the veins of the Starks, and his own gods were the old ones, the nameless, 
faceless gods of the greenwood they shared with the vanished children of the forest. 
At the center of the grove an ancient weirwood brooded over a small pool where the waters were black})"
"(:__Chunk__ {n_tokens: 1200,id: 99818a2793255b98f0633f22fc4b2eb6,text:  Worship was for the sept. 
For her sake, Ned had built a small sept where she might sing to the seven faces of god, but the blood of 
the First Men still flowed in the veins of the Starks, and his own gods were the old ones, the nameless, 
faceless gods of the greenwood they shared with the vanished children of the forest. 
At the center of the grove an ancient weirwood brooded over a small pool where the waters were black 
and cold. \""The heart tree,\"" Ned called it. The weirwood's bark was white as bone, its leaves dark red, 
like a thousand bloodstained hands. A face had been carved in the trunk of the great tree, its features 
long and melancholy, the deep-cut eyes red with dried sap and strangely watchful. They were old, those 
eyes; older than Winterfell itself. They had seen Brandon the Builder set the first stone, if the tales were 
true; they had watched the castle's granite walls rise around them. It was said that the children of the 
forest had carved the faces in the trees during the dawn centuries before the coming of the First Men 
across the narrow sea. 
In the south the last weirwoods had been cut down or burned out a thousand years ago, except on the 
Isle of Faces where the green men kept their silent watch. Up here it was different. Here every castle had 
its godswood, and every godswood had its heart tree, and every heart tree its face. 
Catelyn found her husband beneath the weirwood, seated on a moss-covered stone. The greatsword 
Ice was across his lap, and he was cleaning the blade in those waters black as night. A thousand years of 
humus lay thick upon the godswood floor, swallowing the sound of her feet, but the red eyes of the 
weirwood seemed to follow her as she came. \""Ned,\"" she called softly. 
He lifted his head to look at her. \""Catelyn,\"" he said. His voice was distant and formal. \""Where are the 
children?\"" 
He would always ask her that. \""In the kitchen, arguing about names for the wolf pups.\"" She spread her 
cloak on the forest floor and sat beside the pool, her back to the weirwood. She could feel the eyes 
watching her, but she did her best to ignore them. \""Arya is already in love, and Sansa is charmed and 
gracious, but Rickon is not quite sure.\"" 
\""Is he afraid?\"" Ned asked. 
Page 15

\""A little,\"" she admitted. \""He is only three.\"" 
Ned frowned. \""He must learn to face his fears. He will not be three forever. And winter is coming.\"" 
\""Yes,\"" Catelyn agreed. The words gave her a chill, as they always did. The Stark words. Every noble 
house had its words. Family mottoes, touchstones, prayers of sorts, they boasted of honor and glory, 
promised loyalty and truth, swore faith and courage. All but the Starks. Winter is coming, said the Stark 
words. Not for the first time, she reflected on what a strange people these northerners; were. 
\""The man died well, I'll give him that,\"" Ned said. He had a swatch of oiled leather in one hand. He ran it 
lightly up the greatsword as he spoke, polishing the metal to a dark glow. \""I was glad for Bran's sake. 
You would have been proud of Bran.\"" 
\""I am always proud of Bran,\"" Catelyn replied, watching the sword as he stroked it. She could see the 
rippling deep within the steel, where the metal had been folded back on itself a hundred times in the 
forging. Catelyn had no love for swords, but she could not deny that Ice had its own beauty. It had been 
forged in Valyria, before the Doom had come to the old Freehold, when the ironsmiths had worked their 
metal with spells as well as hammers. Four hundred years old it was, and as sharp as the day it was 
forged. The name it bore was older still, a legacy from the age of heroes, when the Starks were Kings in 
the North. 
\""He was the fourth this year,\"" Ned said grimly. \""The poor man was half-mad. Something had put a fear 
in him so deep that my words could not reach him.\"" He sighed. \""Ben writes that the strength of the 
Night's Watch is down below a thousand. It's not only desertions. They are losing men on rangings as 
well.\"" 
\""Is it the wildlings?\"" she asked. 
\""Who else?\"" Ned lifted Ice, looked down the cool steel length of it. \""And it will only grow worse. The 
day may come when I will have no choice but to call the banners and ride north to deal with this 
Kingbeyond-the-Wall for good and all.\"" 
\""Beyond the Wall?\"" The thought made Catelyn shudder. 
Ned saw the dread on her face. \""Mance Rayder is nothing for us to fear.\"" 
\""There are darker things beyond the Wall.\"" She glanced behind her at the heart tree, the pale bark and 
red eyes, watching, listening, thinking its long slow thoughts. 
His smile was gentle. \""You listen to too many of Old Nan's stories. The Others are as dead as the 
children of the forest, gone eight thousand years. Maester Luwin will tell you they never lived at all. No 
living man has ever seen one.\"" 
\""Until this morning, no living man had ever seen})"
"(:__Chunk__ {n_tokens: 1200,id: f44c377a70f7872bea126b2007f3ce60,text:  the Wall.\"" She glanced behind her at the heart tree, the pale bark and 
red eyes, watching, listening, thinking its long slow thoughts. 
His smile was gentle. \""You listen to too many of Old Nan's stories. The Others are as dead as the 
children of the forest, gone eight thousand years. Maester Luwin will tell you they never lived at all. No 
living man has ever seen one.\"" 
\""Until this morning, no living man had ever seen a direwolf either,\"" Catelyn reminded him. 
\""I ought to know better than to argue with a Tully,\"" he said with a rueful smile. He slid Ice back into its 
sheath. \""You did not come here to tell me crib tales. I know how little you like this place. What is it, my 
lady?\"" 
Catelyn took her husband's hand. \""There was grievous news today, my lord. I did not wish to trouble 
you until you had cleansed yourself.\"" There was no way to soften the blow, so she told him straight. \""I am 
Page 16

so sorry, my love. Jon Arryn is dead.\"" 
His eyes found hers, and she could see how hard it took him, as she had known it would. In his youth, 
Ned had fostered at the Eyrie, and the childless Lord Arryn had become a second father to him and his 
fellow ward, Robert Baratheon. When the Mad King Aerys 11 Targaryen had demanded their heads, 
the Lord of the Eyrie had raised his moon-and-falcon banners in revolt rather than give up those he had 
pledged to protect. 
And one day fifteen years ago, this second father had become a brother as well, as he and Ned stood 
together in the sept at Riverrun to wed two sisters, the daughters of Lord Hoster Tully. 
\""Jon . . .\"" he said. \""Is this news certain?\"" 
\""It was the king's seal, and the letter is in Robert's own hand. I saved it for you. He said Lord Arryn was 
taken quickly. Even Maester Pycelle was helpless, but he brought the milk of the poppy, so Jon did not 
linger long in pain.\"" 
\""That is some small mercy, I suppose,\"" he said. She could see the grief on his face, but even then he 
thought first of her. \""Your sister,\"" he said. \""And Jon's boy. What word of them?\"" 
\""The message said only that they were well, and had returned to the Eyrie,\"" Catelyn said. \""I wish they 
had gone to Riverrun instead. The Eyrie is high and lonely, and it was ever her husband's place, not hers. 
Lord Jon's memory will haunt each stone. I know my sister. She needs the comfort of family and friends 
around her.\"" 
\""Your uncle waits in the Vale, does he not? Jon named him Knight of the Gate, I'd heard.\"" 
Catelyn nodded. \""Brynden will do what he can for her, and for the boy. That is some comfort, but still . . 
.\"" 
\""Go to her,\"" Ned urged. \""Take the children. Fill her halls with noise and shouts and laughter. That boy of 
hers needs other children about him, and Lysa should not be alone in her grief.\"" 
\""Would that I could,\"" Catelyn said. \""The letter had other tidings. The king is riding to Winterfell to seek 
you out.\"" 
It took Ned a moment to comprehend her words, but when the 
understanding came, the darkness left his eyes. \""Robert is coming here?\"" When she nodded, a smile 
broke across his face. 
Catelyn wished she could share his joy. But she had heard the talk in the yards; a direwolf dead in the 
snow, a broken antler in its throat. Dread coiled within her like a snake, but she forced herself to smile at 
this man she loved, this man who put no faith in signs. \""I knew that would please you,\"" she said. \""We 
should send word to your brother on the Wall.\"" 
\""Yes, of course,\"" he agreed. \""Ben will want to be here. I shall tell Maester Luwin to send his swiftest 
bird.\"" Ned rose and pulled her to her feet. \""Damnation, how many years has it been? And he gives us no 
more notice than this? How many in his party, did the message say?\"" 
\""I should think a hundred knights, at the least, with all their retainers, and half again as many freeriders. 
Page 17

Cersei and the children travel with them.\"" 
\""Robert will keep an easy pace for their sakes,\"" he said. \""It is just as well. That will give us more time to 
prepare.\"" 
\""The queen's brothers are also in the party,\"" she told him. 
Ned grimaced at that. There was small love between him and the queen's family, Catelyn knew. The 
Lannisters of Casterly Rock had come late to Robert's cause, when victory was all but certain, and he 
had never forgiven them. \""Well, if the price for Robert's company is an infestation of Lannisters, so be it. 
It sounds as though Robert is bringing half his court.\"" 
\""Where the king goes, the realm follows,\"" she said. 
\""It will be good to see the children. The youngest was still sucking at the Lannister woman's teat the last 
time I saw him. He must be,})"
"(:__Chunk__ {n_tokens: 1200,id: c65d16ede0835e152c3ca0795c4a5723,text:  when victory was all but certain, and he

\""It will be good to see the children. The youngest was still sucking at the Lannister woman's teat the last 
time I saw him. He must be, what, five by now?\"" 
\""Prince Tornmen is seven,\"" she told him. \""The same age as Bran. Please, Ned, guard your tongue. The 
Lannister woman is our queen, and her pride is said to grow with every passing year.\"" 
Ned squeezed her hand. \""There must be a feast, of course, with singers, and Robert will want to hunt. I 
shall send Jory south with an honor guard to meet them on the kingsroad and escort them back. Gods, 
how are we going to feed them all? On his way already, you said? Damn the man. Damn his royal hide.\"" 
DAENERYS 
Her brother held the gown up for her inspection. \""This is beauty. Touch it. Go on. Caress the fabric.\"" 
Dany touched it. The cloth was so smooth that it seemed to run through her fingers like water. She could 
not remember ever wearing anything so soft. It frightened her. She pulled her hand away. \""Is it really 
mine?\"" 
\""A gift from the Magister Illyrio,\"" Viserys said, smiling. Her brother was in a high mood tonight. \""The 
color will bring out the violet in your eyes. And you shall have gold as well, and jewels of all sorts. Illyrio 
has promised. Tonight you must look like a princess.\"" 
A princess, Dany thought. She had forgotten what that was like. Perhaps she had never really known. 
\""Why does he give us so much?\"" she asked. \""What does he want from us?\"" For nigh on half a year, they 
had lived in the magister's house, eating his food, pampered by his servants. Dany was thirteen, old 
enough to know that such gifts seldom come without their price, here in the free city of Pentos. 
\""Illyrio is no fool,\"" Viserys said. He was a gaunt young man with nervous hands and a feverish look in his 
pale lilac eyes. \""The magister knows that I will not forget my friends when I come into my throne.\"" 
Dany said nothing. Magister Illyrio was a dealer in spices, gemstones, dragonbone, and other, less 
savory things. He had friends in all of the Nine Free Cities, it was said, and even beyond, in Vaes 
Dothrak 
and the fabled lands beside the Jade Sea. It was also said that he'd never had a friend he wouldn't 
Page 18

cheerfully sell for the right price. Dany listened to the talk in the streets, and she heard these things, but 
she knew better than to question her brother when he wove his webs of dream. His anger was a terrible 
thing when roused. Viserys called it \""waking the dragon.\"" 
Her brother hung the gown beside the door. \""Illyrio will send the slaves to bathe you. Be sure you wash 
off the stink of the stables. Khal Drogo has a thousand horses, tonight he looks for a different sort of 
mount.\"" He studied her critically. \""You still slouch. Straighten yourself\"" He pushed back her shoulders 
with his hands. \""Let them see that you have a woman's shape now.\"" His fingers brushed lightly over her 
budding breasts and tightened on a nipple. \""You will not fail me tonight. If you do, it will go hard for you. 
You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?\"" His fingers twisted her, the pinch cruelly hard through the 
rough fabric of her tunic. \""Do you?\"" he repeated. 
\""No,\"" Dany said meekly. 
Her brother smiled. \""Good.\"" He touched her hair, almost with affection. \""When they write the history of 
my reign, sweet sister, they will say that it began tonight.\"" 
When he was gone, Dany went to her window and looked out wistfully on the waters of the bay. The 
square brick towers of Pentos were black silhouettes outlined against the setting sun. Dany could hear the 
singing of the red priests as they lit their night fires and the shouts of ragged children playing games 
beyond the walls of the estate. For a moment she wished she could be out there with them, barefoot and 
breathless and dressed in tatters, with no past and no future and no feast to attend at Khal Drogo's 
manse. 
Somewhere beyond the sunset, across the narrow sea, lay a land of green hills and flowered plains and 
great rushing rivers, where towers of dark stone rose amidst magnificent blue-grey mountains, and 
armored knights rode to battle beneath the banners of their lords. The Dothraki called that land Rhaesh 
Andahli, the land of the Andals. In the Free Cities, they talked of Westeros and the Sunset Kingdoms. 
Her brother had a simpler name. \""Our land,\"" he called it. The words were like a prayer with him. If he 
said them enough, the gods were sure to hear. \""Ours by blood right, taken from us by treachery, but ours 
still, ours forever. You do not})"

Her brother had a simpler name. \""Our land,\"" he called it. The words were like a prayer with him. If he 
said them enough, the gods were sure to hear. \""Ours by blood right, taken from us by treachery, but ours 
still, ours forever. You do not steal from the dragon, oh, no. The dragon remembers.\"" 
And perhaps the dragon did remember, but Dany could not. She had never seen this land her brother 
said was theirs, this realm beyond the narrow sea. These places he talked of, Casterly Rock and the 
Eyrie, Highgarden and the Vale of Arryn, Dorne and the Isle of Faces, they were just words to her. 
Viserys had been a boy of eight when they fled King's Landing to escape the advancing armies of the 
Usurper, but Daenerys had been only a quickening in their mother's womb. 
Yet sometimes Dany would picture the way it had been, so often had her brother told her the stories. 
The midnight flight to Dragonstone, moonlight shimmering on the ship's black sails. Her brother Rhaegar 
battling the Usurper in the bloody waters of the Trident and dying for the woman he loved. The sack of 
King's Landing by the ones Viserys called the Usurper's dogs, the lords Lannister and Stark. Princess 
Elia of Dorne pleading for mercy as Rhaegar's heir was ripped from her breast and murdered before her 
eyes. The polished skulls of the last dragons staring down sightlessly from the walls of the throne room 
while the Kingslayer opened Father's throat with a golden sword. 
She had been born on Dragonstone nine moons after their flight, while a raging summer storm threatened 
to rip the island fastness apart. They said that storm was terrible. The Targaryen fleet was smashed while 
it lay at anchor, and huge stone blocks were ripped from the parapets and sent hurtling into the wild 
waters of the narrow sea. Her mother had died birthing her, and for that her brother Viserys had never 
Page 19

forgiven her. 
She did not remember Dragonstone either. They had run again, just before the Usurper's brother set sail 
with his new-built fleet. By then only Dragonstone itself, the ancient seat of their House, had remained of 
the Seven Kingdoms that had once been theirs. It would not remain for long. The garrison had been 
prepared to sell them to the Usurper, but one night Ser Willem Darry and four loyal men had broken into 
the nursery and stolen them both, along with her wet nurse, and set sail under cover of darkness for the 
safety of the Braavosian coast. 
She remembered Ser Willem dimly, a great grey bear of a man, halfblind, roaring and bellowing orders 
from his sickbed. The servants had lived in terror of him, but he had always been kind to Dany. He called 
her \""Little Princess\"" and sometimes \""My Lady,\"" and his hands were soft as old leather. He never left his 
bed, though, and the smell of sickness clung to him day and night, a hot, moist, sickly sweet odor. That 
was when they lived in Braavos, in the big house with the red door. Dany had her own room there, with a 
lemon tree outside her window. After Ser Willem had died, the servants had stolen what little money they 
had left, and soon after they had been put out of the big house. Dany had cried when the red door closed 
behind them forever. 
They had wandered since then, from Braavos to Myr, from Myr to Tyrosh, and on to Qohor and 
Volantis and Lys, never staying long in 
any one place. Her brother would not allow it. The Usurper's hired knives were close behind them, he 
insisted, though Dany had never seen one. 
At first the magisters and archons and merchant princes were pleased to welcome the last Targaryens to 
their homes and tables, but as the years passed and the Usurper continued to sit upon the Iron Throne, 
doors closed and their lives grew meaner. Years past they had been forced to sell their last few treasures, 
and now even the coin they had gotten from Mother's crown had gone. In the alleys and wine sinks of 
Pentos, they called her brother \""the beggar king.\"" Dany did not want to know what they called her. 
\""We will have it all back someday, sweet sister,\"" he would promise her. Sometimes his hands shook 
when he talked about it. \""The jewels and the silks, Dragonstone and King's Landing, the Iron Throne and 
the Seven Kingdoms, all they have taken from us, we will have it back.\"" Viserys lived for that day. All 
that Daenerys wanted back was the big house with the red door, the lemon tree outside her window, the 
childhood she had never known. 
There came a soft knock on her door. \""Come,\"" Dany said, turning away from the window. Illyrio's 
servants entered, bowed, and set about their business. They were slaves, a gift from one of the magister's

"(:__Chunk__ {n_tokens: 1200,id: dc222c25c70fe00264b5ba4c4207aa75,text:  the big house with the red door, the lemon tree outside her window, the 
childhood she had never known. 
There came a soft knock on her door. \""Come,\"" Dany said, turning away from the window. Illyrio's 
servants entered, bowed, and set about their business. They were slaves, a gift from one of the magister's 
many Dothraki friends. There was no slavery in the free city of Pentos. Nonetheless, they were slaves. 
The old woman, small and grey as a mouse, never said a word, but the girl made up for it. She was 
Illyrio's favorite, a fair-haired, blue-eyed wench of sixteen who chattered constantly as she worked. 
They filled her bath with hot water brought up from the kitchen and scented it with fragrant oils. The girl 
pulled the rough cotton tunic over Dany's head and helped her into the tub. The water was scalding hot, 
but Daenerys did not flinch or cry out. She liked the heat. It made her feel clean. Besides, her brother 
had often told her that it was never too 
hot for a Targaryen. \""Ours is the house of the dragon,\"" he would say. \""The fire is in our blood.\"" 
The old woman washed her long, silver-pale hair and gently combed out the snags, all in silence. The girl 
scrubbed her back and her feet and told her how lucky she was. \""Drogo is so rich that even his slaves 
Page 20

wear golden collars. A hundred thousand men ride in his khalasar, and 
his palace in Vaes Dothrak has two hundred rooms and doors of solid silver.\"" There was more like that, 
so much more, what a handsome 
man the khal was, so tall and fierce, fearless in battle, the best rider ever to mount a horse, a demon 
archer. Daenerys said nothing. She had always assumed that she would wed Viserys when she came of 
age. 
For centuries the Targaryens had married brother to sister, since Aegon the Conqueror had taken his 
sisters to bride. The line must be kept pure, Viserys had told her a thousand times; theirs was the 
kingsblood, the golden blood of old Valyria, the blood of the dragon. Dragons did not mate with the 
beasts of the field, and Targaryens did not mingle their blood with that of lesser men. Yet now Viserys 
schemed to sell her to a stranger, a barbarian. 
When she was clean, the slaves helped her from the water and toweled her dry. The girl brushed her hair 
until it shone like molten silver, while the old woman anointed her with the spiceflower perfume of the 
Dothraki plains, a dab on each wrist, behind her ears, on the tips of her breasts, and one last one, cool 
on her lips, down there between her legs. They dressed her in the wisps that Magister Illyrio had sent up, 
and then the gown, a deep plum silk to bring out the violet in her eyes. The girl slid the gilded sandals 
onto her feet, while the old woman fixed the tiara in her hair, and slid golden bracelets crusted with 
amethysts around her wrists. Last of all came the collar, a heavy golden tore emblazoned with ancient 
Valyrian glyphs. 
\""Now you look all a princess,\"" the girl said breathlessly when they were done. Dany glanced at her 
image in the silvered looking glass that Illyrio had so thoughtfully provided. A princess, she thought, but 
she remembered what the girl had said, how Khal Drogo was so rich even his slaves wore golden collars. 
She felt a sudden chill, and gooseflesh pimpled her bare arms. 
Her brother was waiting in the cool of the entry hall, seated on the edge of the pool, his hand trailing in 
the water. He rose when she appeared and looked her over critically. \""Stand there,\"" he told her. \""Turn 
around. Yes. Good. You look . . .\"" 
\""Regal,\"" Magister Illyrio said, stepping through an archway. He moved with surprising delicacy for such 
a massive man. Beneath loose garments of flame-colored silk, rolls of fat jiggled as he walked. 
Gemstones glittered on every finger, and his man had oiled his forked yellow beard until it shone like real 
gold. \""May the Lord of Light shower you with blessings on this most fortunate day, Princess Daenerys,\"" 
the magister said as he took her hand. He bowed his head, showing a thin glimpse of crooked yellow 
teeth through the gold of his beard. \""She is a vision, Your Grace, a vision,\"" he told her brother. \""Drogo 
will be enraptured.\"" 
\""She's too skinny,\"" Viserys said. His hair, the same silver-blond as hers, had been pulled back tightly 
behind his head and fastened with a dragonbone brooch. It was a severe look that emphasized the hard, 
gaunt lines of his face. He rested his hand on the hilt of the sword that 
Illyrio had lent him, and said, \""Are you sure that Khal Drogo likes his women this young?\"" 
\""She has had her blood. She is old enough for the khal, \"" Illyrio told him, not for the first time. \""Look at 
her. That silvergold hair, those purple eyes})"
"(:__Chunk__ {n_tokens: 1200,id: c25e4ab84ab44785f3a3cba71d9b6928,text: och. It was a severe look that emphasized the hard, 
gaunt lines of his face. He rested his hand on the hilt of the sword that 
Illyrio had lent him, and said, \""Are you sure that Khal Drogo likes his women this young?\"" 
\""She has had her blood. She is old enough for the khal, \"" Illyrio told him, not for the first time. \""Look at 
her. That silvergold hair, those purple eyes . . . she is the blood of old Valyria, no doubt, no doubt . . . 
and highborn, daughter of the old king, sister to the new, she cannot fail to entrance our Drogo.\"" When 
he released her hand, Daenerys found herself trembling. 
Page 21

\""I suppose,\"" her brother said doubtfully. \""The savages have queer tastes. Boys, horses, sheep . . .\"" 
\""Best not suggest this to Khal Drogo,\"" Illyrio said. 
Anger flashed in her brother's lilac eyes. \""Do you take me for a fool?\"" 
The magister bowed slightly. \""I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My 
apologies if I have given offense.\"" He turned away and clapped his hands for his bearers. 
The streets of Pentos were pitch-dark when they set out in Illyrio's elaborately carved palanquin. Two 
servants went ahead to light their way, carrying ornate oil lanterns with panes of pale blue glass, while a 
dozen strong men hoisted the poles to their shoulders. It was warm and close inside behind the curtains. 
Dany could smell the stench of Illyrio's pallid flesh through his heavy perfumes. 
Her brother, sprawled out on his pillows beside her, never noticed. His mind was away across the 
narrow sea. \""We won't need his whole khalasar, \"" Viserys said. His fingers toyed with the hilt of his 
borrowed blade, though Dany knew he had never used a sword in earnest. \""Ten thousand, that would be 
enough, I could sweep the Seven Kingdoms with ten thousand Dothraki screamers. The realm will rise 
for its rightful king. Tyrell, Redwyne, Darry, Greyjoy, they have no more love for the Usurper than I do. 
The Dornishmen burn to avenge Elia and her children. And the smallfolk will be with us. They cry out for 
their king.\"" He looked at Illyrio anxiously. \""They do, don't they?\"" 
\""They are your people, and they love you well,\"" Magister Illyrio said amiably. \""In holdfasts all across the 
realm, men lift secret toasts to your health while women sew dragon banners and hide them against the 
day of your return from across the water.\"" He gave a massive shrug. \""Or so my agents tell me.\"" 
Dany had no agents, no way of knowing what anyone was doing or thinking across the narrow sea, but 
she mistrusted Illyrio's sweet words as she mistrusted everything about Illyrio. Her brother was nodding 
eagerly, however. \""I shall kill the Usurper myself,\"" he promised, who 
had never killed anyone, \""as he killed my brother Rhaegar. And Lannister too, the Kingslayer, for what 
he did to my father.\"" 
\""That would be most fitting,\"" Magister Illyrio said. Dany saw the smallest hint of a smile playing around 
his full lips, but her brother did not notice. Nodding, he pushed back a curtain and stared off into the 
night, and Dany knew he was fighting the Battle of the Trident once again. 
The nine-towered manse of Khal Drogo sat beside the waters of the bay, its high brick walls overgrown 
with pale ivy. It had been given to the khal by the magisters of Pentos, Illyrio told them. The Free Cities 
were always generous with the horselords. \""It is not that we fear these barbarians,\"" Illyrio would explain 
with a smile. \""The Lord of Light would hold our city walls against a million Dothraki, or so the red priests 
promise . . . yet why take chances, when their friendship comes so cheap?\"" 
Their palanquin was stopped at the gate, the curtains pulled roughly back by one of the house guards. 
He had the copper skin and dark almond eyes of a Dothraki, but his face was hairless and he wore the 
spiked bronze cap of the Unsullied. He looked them over coldly. Magister Illyrio growled something to 
him in the rough Dothraki tongue; the guardsman replied in the same voice and waved them through the 
gates. 
Dany noticed that her brother's hand was clenched tightly around the hilt of his borrowed sword. He 
Page 22

looked almost as frightened as she felt. \""Insolent eunuch,\"" Viserys muttered as the palanquin lurched up 
toward the manse. 
Magister Illyrio's words were honey. \""Many important men will be at the feast tonight. Such men have 
enemies. The khal must protect his guests, yourself chief among them, Your Grace. No doubt the 
Usurper would pay well for your head.\"" 
\""Oh, yes,\"" Viserys said darkly. \""He has tried, Illyrio, I promise you that. His hired knives follow us 
everywhere. I am the last dragon, and he})"
"(:__Chunk__ {n_tokens: 1200,id: a7b146d12d30f2acc7fea017069c6308,text: ister Illyrio's words were honey. \""Many important men will be at the feast tonight. Such men have

\""Oh, yes,\"" Viserys said darkly. \""He has tried, Illyrio, I promise you that. His hired knives follow us 
everywhere. I am the last dragon, and he will not sleep easy while I live.\"" 
The palanquin slowed and stopped. The curtains were thrown back, and a slave offered a hand to help 
Daenerys out. His collar, she noted, was ordinary bronze. Her brother followed, one hand still clenched 
hard around his sword hilt. It took two strong men to get Magister Illyrio back on his feet. 
Inside the manse, the air was heavy with the scent of spices, pinchfire and sweet lemon and cinnamon. 
They were escorted across the entry hall, where a mosaic of colored glass depicted the Doom of Valyria. 
Oil burned in black iron lanterns all along the walls. Beneath 
an arch of twining stone leaves, a eunuch sang their coming. \""Viserys of the House Targaryen, the Third 
of his Name,\"" he called in a high, sweet voice, \""King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, 
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. His sister, Daenerys Stormborn, Princess of 
Dragonstone. His honorable host, Illyrio Mopatis, Magister of the Free City of Pentos.\"" 
They stepped past the eunuch into a pillared courtyard overgrown in pale ivy. Moonlight painted the 
leaves in shades of bone and silver as the guests drifted among them. Many were Dothraki horselords, 
big men with red-brown skin, their drooping mustachios bound in metal rings, their black hair oiled and 
braided and hung with bells. Yet among them moved bravos and sellswords from Pentos and Myr and 
Tyrosh, a red priest even fatter than Illyrio, hairy men from the Port of Ibben, and lords from the Summer 
Isles with skin as black as ebony. Daenerys looked at them all in wonder . . . and realized, with a sudden 
start of fear, that she was the only woman there. 
Illyrio whispered to them. \""Those three are Drogo's bloodriders, there,\"" he said. \""By the pillar is Khal 
Moro, with his son Rhogoro. The man with the green beard is brother to the Archon of Tyrosh, and the 
man behind him is Ser Jorah Mormont.\"" 
The last name caught Daenerys. \""A knight?\"" 
\""No less.\"" Illyrio smiled through his beard. \""Anointed with the seven oils by the High Septon himself.\"" 
\""What is he doing here?\"" she blurted. 
\""The Usurper wanted his head,\"" Illyrio told them. \""Some trifling affront. He sold some poachers to a 
Tyroshi slaver instead of giving them to the Night's Watch. Absurd law. A man should be able to do as 
he likes with his own chattel.\"" 
\""I shall wish to speak with Ser Jorah before the night is done,\"" her brother said. Dany found herself 
looking at the knight curiously. He was an older man, past forty and balding, but still strong and fit. 
Instead of silks and cottons, he wore wool and leather. His tunic was a dark green, embroidered with the 
likeness of a black bear standing on two legs. 
She was still looking at this strange man from the homeland she had never known when Magister Illyrio 
Page 23

placed a moist hand on her bare shoulder. \""Over there, sweet princess,\"" he whispered, \""there is the khal 
himself.\"" 
Dany wanted to run and hide, but her brother was looking at her, and if she displeased him she knew 
she would wake the dragon. Anxiously, she turned and looked at the man Viserys hoped would ask to 
wed her before the night was done. 
The slave girl had not been far wrong, she thought. Khal Drogo was a head taller than the tallest man in 
the room, yet somehow light on his feet, as graceful as the panther in Illyrio's menagerie. He was younger 
than she'd thought, no more than thirty. His skin was the color of polished copper, his thick mustachios 
bound with gold and bronze rings. 
\""I must go and make my submissions,\"" Magister Illyrio said. \""Wait here. I shall bring him to you.\"" 
Her brother took her by the arm as Illyrio waddled over to the khal, his fingers squeezing so hard that 
they hurt. \""Do you see his braid, sweet sister?\"" 
Drogo's braid was black as midnight and heavy with scented oil, hung with tiny bells that rang softly as 
he moved. It swung well past his belt, below even his buttocks, the end of it brushing against the back of 
his thighs. 
\""You see how long it is?\"" Viserys said. \""When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braids 
in disgrace, so the world will know their shame. Khal Drogo has never lost a fight. He is Aegon the 
Dragonlord come again, and you will be his queen.\""

\""You see how long it is?\"" Viserys said. \""When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braids 
in disgrace, so the world will know their shame. Khal Drogo has never lost a fight. He is Aegon the 
Dragonlord come again, and you will be his queen.\"" 
Dany looked at Khal Drogo. His face was hard and cruel, his eyes as cold and dark as onyx. Her 
brother hurt her sometimes, when she woke the dragon, but he did not frighten her the way this man 
frightened her. \""I don't want to be his queen,\"" she heard herself say in a small, thin voice. \""Please, please, 
Viserys, I don't want to, I want to go home.\"" 
\""Home?\"" He kept his voice low, but she could hear the fury in his tone. \""How are we to go home, sweet 
sister? They took our home from us!\"" He drew her into the shadows, out of sight, his fingers digging into 
her skin. \""How are we to go home?\"" he repeated, meaning King's Landing, and Dragonstone, and all the 
realm they had lost. 
Dany had only meant their rooms in Illyrio's estate, no true home surely, though all they had, but her 
brother did not want to hear that. There was no home there for him. Even the big house with the red door 
had not been home for him. His fingers dug hard into her arm, demanding an answer. \""I don't know she 
said at last, her voice breaking. Tears welled in her eyes. 
\""I do,\"" he said sharply. \""We go home with an army, sweet sister. With Khal Drogo's army, that is how 
we go home. And if you must wed him and bed him for that, you will.\"" He smiled at her. \""I'd let his whole 
khalasar fuck you if need be, sweet sister, all forty thousand men, and their horses too if that was what it 
took to get my army. Be grateful it is 
only Drogo. In time you may even learn to like him. Now dry your eyes. Illyrio is bringing him over, and 
he will not see you crying.\"" 
Dany turned and saw that it was true. Magister Illyrio, all smiles and bows, was escorting Khal Drogo 
over to where they stood. She brushed away unfallen tears with the back of her hand. 
Page 24

\""Smile,\"" Viserys whispered nervously, his hand failing to the hilt of his sword. \""And stand up straight. Let 
him see that you have breasts. Gods know, you have little enough as is.\"" 
Daenerys smiled, and stood up straight. 
EDDARD 
The visitors poured through the castle gates in a river of gold and silver and polished steel, three hundred 
strong, a pride of bannermen and knights, of sworn swords and freeriders. Over their heads a dozen 
golden banners whipped back and forth in the northern wind, emblazoned with the crowned stag of 
Baratheon. 
Ned knew many of the riders. There came Ser Jaime Lannister with hair as bright as beaten gold, and 
there Sandor Clegane with his terrible burned face. The tall boy beside him could only be the crown 
prince, and that stunted little man behind them was surely the Imp, Tyrion Lannister. 
Yet the huge man at the head of the column, flanked by two knights in the snow-white cloaks of the 
Kingsguard, seemed almost a stranger to Ned . . . until he vaulted off the back of his warhorse with a 
familiar roar, and crushed him in a bone-crunching hug. \""Ned! Ah, but it is good to see that frozen face of 
yours.\"" The king looked him over top to bottom, and laughed. \""You have not changed at all.\"" 
Would that Ned had been able to say the same. Fifteen years past, when they had ridden forth to win a 
throne, the Lord of Storm's End had been clean-shaven, clear-eyed, and muscled like a maiden's fantasy. 
Six and a half feet tall, he towered over lesser men, and when he donned his armor and the great antlered 
helmet of his House, he became a veritable giant. He'd had a giant's strength too, his weapon 
of choice a spiked iron warhammer that Ned could scarcely lift. In those days, the smell of leather and 
blood had clung to him like perfume. 
Now it was perfume that clung to him like perfume, and he had a girth to match his height. Ned had last 
seen the king nine years before during Balon Greyjoy's rebellion, when the stag and the direwolf had 
joined to end the pretensions of the self-proclaimed King of the Iron Islands. Since the night they had 
stood side by side in Greyjoy's fallen stronghold, where Robert had accepted the rebel lord's surrender 
and Ned had taken his son Theon as hostage and ward, the king had gained at least eight stone. A beard 
as coarse and black as iron wire covered his jaw to hide his double chin and the sag of the royal jowls, 
but nothing could hide his stomach or the dark circles under his eyes. 
Yet Robert was Ned's king now, and not just a friend, so he})"

and Ned had taken his son Theon as hostage and ward, the king had gained at least eight stone. A beard 
as coarse and black as iron wire covered his jaw to hide his double chin and the sag of the royal jowls, 
but nothing could hide his stomach or the dark circles under his eyes. 
Yet Robert was Ned's king now, and not just a friend, so he said only, \""Your Grace. Winterfell is 
yours.\"" 
By then the others were dismounting as well, and grooms were coming forward for their mounts. 
Robert's queen, Cersei Lannister, entered on foot with her younger children. The wheelhouse in which 
they had ridden, a huge double-decked carriage of oiled oak and gilded metal pulled by forty heavy draft 
horses, was too wide to pass through the castle gate. Ned knelt in the snow to kiss the queen's ring, 
while Robert embraced Catelyn like a long-lost sister. Then the children had been brought forward, 
introduced, and approved of by both sides. 
No sooner had those formalities of greeting been completed than the king had said to his host, \""Take me 
down to your crypt, Eddard. I would pay my respects.\"" 
Page 25

Ned loved him for that, for remembering her still after all these years. He called for a lantern. No other 
words were needed. The queen had begun to protest. They had been riding since dawn, everyone was 
tired and cold, surely they should refresh themselves first. The dead would wait. She had said no more 
than that; Robert had looked at her, and her twin brother Jaime had taken her quietly by the arm, and she 
had said no more. 
They went down to the crypt together, Ned and this king he scarcely recognized. The winding stone 
steps were narrow. Ned went first with the lantern. \""I was starting to think we would never reach 
Winterfell,\"" Robert complained as they descended. \""In the south, the way they talk about my Seven 
Kingdoms, a man forgets that your part is as big as the other six combined.\"" 
\""I trust you enjoyed the journey, Your Grace?\"" 
Robert snorted. \""Bogs and forests and fields, and scarcely a decent 
inn north of the Neck. I've never seen such a vast emptiness. Where are all yourpeople?\"" 
\""Likely they were too shy to come out,\"" Ned jested. He could feel the chill coming up the stairs, a cold 
breath from deep within the earth. \""Kings are a rare sight in the north.\"" 
Robert snorted. \""More likely they were hiding under the snow. Snow, Ned!\"" The king put one hand on 
the wall to steady himself as they descended. 
\""Late summer snows are common enough,\"" Ned said. \""I hope they did not trouble you. They are usually 
mild.\"" 
\""The Others take your mild snows,\"" Robert swore. \""What will this place be like in winter? I shudder to 
think.\"" 
\""The winters are hard,\"" Ned admitted. \""But the Starks will endure. We always have.\"" 
\""You need to come south,\"" Robert told him. \""You need a taste of summer before it flees. In Highgarden 
there are fields of golden roses that stretch away as far as the eye can see. The fruits are so ripe they 
explode in your mouth-melons, peaches, fireplums, you've never tasted such sweetness. You'll see, I 
brought you some. Even at Storm's End, with that good wind off the bay, the days are so hot you can 
barely move. And you ought to see the towns, Ned! Flowers everywhere, the markets bursting with 
food, the surnmerwines so cheap and so good that you can get drunk just breathing the air. Everyone is 
fat and drunk and rich.\"" He laughed and slapped his own ample stomach a thump. \""And the girls, Ned!\"" 
he exclaimed, his eyes sparkling. \""I swear, women lose all modesty in the heat. They swim naked in the 
river, right beneath the castle. Even in the streets, it's too damn hot for wool or fur, so they go around in 
these short gowns, silk if they have the silver and cotton if not, but it's all the same when they start 
sweating and the cloth sticks to their skin, they might as well be naked.\"" The king laughed happily. 
Robert Baratheon had always been a man of huge appetites, a man who knew how to take his 
pleasures. That was not a charge anyone could lay at the door of Eddard Stark. Yet Ned could not help 
but notice that those pleasures were taking a toll on the king. Robert was breathing heavily by the time 
they reached the bottom of the stairs, his face red in the lantern light as they stepped out into the darkness 
of the crypt. 
\""Your Grace,\"" Ned said respectfully. He swept the lantern in a wide semicircle. Shadows moved and

lurched. Flickering light touched the stones underfoot and brushed against a long procession of granite 
pillars that marched ahead, two by two, into the dark. Between the 
pillars, the dead sat on their stone thrones against the walls, backs against the sepulchres that contained 
their mortal remains. \""She is down at the end, with Father and Brandon.\"" 
He led the way between the pillars and Robert followed wordlessly, shivering in the subterranean chill.})"
"(:__Chunk__ {n_tokens: 1200,id: f32a41d2b926535374c97d40e128d477,text:  Flickering light touched the stones underfoot and brushed against a long procession of granite 
pillars that marched ahead, two by two, into the dark. Between the 
pillars, the dead sat on their stone thrones against the walls, backs against the sepulchres that contained 
their mortal remains. \""She is down at the end, with Father and Brandon.\"" 
He led the way between the pillars and Robert followed wordlessly, shivering in the subterranean chill. It 
was always cold down here. Their footsteps rang off the stones and echoed in the vault overhead as they 
walked among the dead of House Stark. The Lords of Winterfell watched them pass. Their likenesses 
were carved into the stones that sealed the tombs. In long rows they sat, blind eyes staring out into 
eternal darkness, while great stone direwolves curled round their feet. The shifting shadows made the 
stone figures seem to stir as the living passed by. 
By ancient custom an iron longsword had been laid across the lap of each who had been Lord of 
Winterfell, to keep the vengeful spirits in their crypts. The oldest had long ago rusted away to nothing, 
leaving only a few red stains where the metal had rested on stone. Ned wondered if that meant those 
ghosts were free to roam the castle now. He hoped not. The first Lords of Winterfell had been men hard 
as the land they ruled. In the centuries before the Dragonlords came over the sea, they had sworn 
allegiance to no man, styling themselves the Kings in the North. 
Ned stopped at last and lifted the oil lantern. The crypt continued on into darkness ahead of them, but 
beyond this point the tombs were empty and unsealed; black holes waiting for their dead, waiting for him 
and his children. Ned did not like to think on that. \""Here,\"" he told his king. 
Robert nodded silently, knelt, and bowed his head. 
There were three tombs, side by side. Lord Rickard Stark, Ned's father, had a long, stern face. The 
stonemason had known him well. He sat with quiet dignity, stone fingers holding tight to the sword across 
his lap, but in life all swords had failed him. In two smaller sepulchres on either side were his children. 
Brandon had been twenty when he died, strangled by order of the Mad King Aerys Targaryen only a 
few short days before he was to wed Catelyn Tully of Riverrun. His father had been forced to watch him 
die. He was the true heir, the eldest, born to rule. 
Lyanna had only been sixteen, a child-woman of surpassing loveliness. Ned had loved her with all his 
heart. Robert had loved her even more. She was to have been his bride. 
\""She was more beautiful than that,\"" the king said after a silence. His eyes lingered on Lyanna's face, as if 
he could will her back to life. Finally he rose, made awkward by his weight. \""Ah, damn it, Ned, did 
you have to bury her in a place like this?\"" His voice was hoarse with remembered grief. \""She deserved 
more than darkness . . .\"" 
\""She was a Stark of Winterfell,\"" Ned said quietly. \""This is her place.\"" 
\""She should be on a hill somewhere, under a fruit tree, with the sun and clouds above her and the rain to 
wash her clean.\"" 
\""I was with her when she died,\"" Ned reminded the king. \""She wanted to come home, to rest beside 
Brandon and Father.\"" He could hear her still at times. Promise me, she had cried, in a room that smelled 
of blood and roses. Promise me, Ned. The fever had taken her strength and her voice had been faint as a 
Page 27

whisper, but when he gave her his word, the fear had gone out of his sister's eyes. Ned remembered the 
way she had smiled then, how tightly her fingers had clutched his as she gave up her hold on life, the rose 
petals spilling from her palm, dead and black. After that he remembered nothing. They had found him still 
holding her body, silent with grief. The little crannogman, Howland Reed, had taken her hand from his. 
Ned could recall none of it. \""I bring her flowers when I can,\"" he said. \""Lyanna was . . . fond of flowers.\"" 
The king touched her cheek, his fingers brushing across the rough stone as gently as if it were living flesh. 
\""I vowed to kill Rhaegar for what he did to her.\"" 
\""You did,\"" Ned reminded him. 
\""Only once,\"" Robert said bitterly. 
They had come together at the ford of the Trident while the battle crashed around them, Robert with his 
warhammer and his great antlered helm, the Targaryen prince armored all in black. On his breastplate 
was the three-headed dragon of his House, wrought all in rubies that flashed like fire in the sunlight. The 
waters of the Trident ran red around the hooves of their destriers as they circled and clashed, again and 
again, until at last a crushing blow from Robert's hammer stove in the dragon and the chest beneath it. 
When Ned had finally come on the scene, Rhaegar lay dead in the stream, while men of both armies 
scrabbled in the swirling waters for rubies knocked free of his armor. 
\""In my dreams, I kill him every night,\"" Robert admitted. \""A thousand deaths will still be less than he 
deserves.\""

\""In my dreams, I kill him every night,\"" Robert admitted. \""A thousand deaths will still be less than he 
deserves.\"" 
There was nothing Ned could say to that. After a quiet, he said, \""We should return, Your Grace. Your 
wife will be waiting.\"" 
\""The Others take my wife,\"" Robert muttered sourly, but he started back the way they had come, his 
footsteps falling heavily. \""And if I hear 'Your Grace' once more, I'll have your head on a spike. We are 
more to each other than that.\"" 
\""I had not forgotten,\"" Ned replied quietly. When the king did not answer, he said, \""Tell me about Jon.\"" 
Robert shook his head. \""I have never seen a man sicken so quickly. We gave a tourney on my son's 
name day. If you had seen Jon then, you would have sworn he would live forever. A fortnight later he 
was dead. The sickness was like a fire in his gut. It burned right through him.\"" He paused beside a pillar, 
before the tomb of a long-dead Stark. \""I loved that old man.\"" 
\""We both did.\"" Ned paused a moment. \""Catelyn fears for her sister. How does Lysa bear her grief?\"" 
Robert's mouth gave a bitter twist. \""Not well, in truth,\"" he admitted. \""I think losing Jon has driven the 
woman mad, Ned. She has taken the boy back to the Eyrie. Against my wishes. I had hoped to foster 
him with Tywin Lannister at Casterly Rock. Jon had no brothers, no other sons. Was I supposed to leave 
him to be raised by women?\"" 
Ned would sooner entrust a child to a pit viper than to Lord Tywin, but he left his doubts unspoken. 
Some old wounds never truly heal, and bleed again at the slightest word. \""The wife has lost the husband,\"" 
he said carefully. \""Perhaps-the mother feared to lose the son. The boy is very young.\"" 
\""Six, and sickly, and Lord of the Eyrie, gods have mercy,\"" the king swore. \""Lord Tywin had never taken 
a ward before. Lysa ought to have been honored. The Lannisters are a great and noble House. She 
Page 28

refused to even hear of it. Then she left in the dead of night, without so much as a by-your-leave. Cersei 
was furious.\"" He sighed deeply. \""The boy is my namesake, did you know that? Robert Arryn. I am 
sworn to protect him. How can I do that if his mother steals him away?\"" 
\""I will take him as ward, if you wish,\"" Ned said. \""Lysa should consent to that. She and Catelyn were 
close as girls, and she would be welcome here as well.\"" 
\""A generous offer, my friend,\"" the king said, \""but too late. Lord Tywin has already given his consent. 
Fostering the boy elsewhere would be a grievous affront to him.\"" 
\""I have more concern for my nephew's welfare than I do for Lannister pride,\"" Ned declared. 
\""That is because you do not sleep with a Lannister.\"" Robert laughed, the sound rattling among the tombs 
and bouncing from the vaulted ceiling. His smile was a flash of white teeth in the thicket of the huge black 
beard. \""Ah, Ned,\"" he said, \""you are still too serious.\"" He put a massive arm around Ned's shoulders. \""I 
had planned to wait a few days to speak to you, but I see now there's no need for it. Come, walk with 
me.\"" 
They started back down between the pillars. Blind stone eyes seemed to follow them as they passed. 
The king kept his arm around Ned's shoulder. \""You must have wondered why I finally came north to 
Winterfell, after so long.\"" 
Ned had his suspicions, but he did not give them voice. \""For the joy of my company, surely,\"" he said 
lightly. \""And there is the Wall. You need to see it, Your Grace, to walk along its battlements and talk to 
those who man it. The Night's Watch is a shadow of what it once was. Benjen says-\"" 
\""No doubt I will hear what your brother says soon enough,\"" Robert said. \""The Wall has stood for what, 
eight thousand years? It can keep a few days more. I have more pressing concerns. These are difficult 
times. I need good men about me. Men like Jon Arryn. He served as Lord of the Eyrie, as Warden of 
the East, as the Hand of the King. He will not be easy to replace.\"" 
\""His son . . .\"" Ned began. 
\""His son will succeed to the Eyrie and all its incomes,\"" Robert said brusquely. \""No more.\"" 
That took Ned by surprise. He stopped, startled, and turned to look at his king. The words came 
unbidden. \""The Arryns have always been Wardens of the East. The title goes with the domain.\"" 
\""Perhaps when he comes of age, the honor can be restored to him,\"" Robert said. \""I have this year to 
think of, and next. A six})"
"(:__Chunk__ {n_tokens: 1200,id: eb1c2b6d937bd4fd36418bf341e3975c,text: rie and all its incomes,\"" Robert said brusquely. \""No more.\"" 
That took Ned by surprise. He stopped, startled, and turned to look at his king. The words came 
unbidden. \""The Arryns have always been Wardens of the East. The title goes with the domain.\"" 
\""Perhaps when he comes of age, the honor can be restored to him,\"" Robert said. \""I have this year to 
think of, and next. A six-year-old boy is no war leader, Ned.\"" 
\""In peace, the title is only an honor. Let the boy keep it. For his father's sake if not his own. Surely you 
owe, Jon that much for his service.\"" 
The king was not pleased. He took his arm from around Ned's shoulders. \""Jon's service was the duty he 
owed his liege lord. I am not ungrateful, Ned. You of all men ought to know that. But the son is not the 
father. A mere boy cannot hold the east.\"" Then his tone softened. \""Enough of this. There is a more 
important office to discuss, and I would not argue with you.\"" Robert grasped Ned by the elbow. \""I have 
need of you, Ned.\"" 
\""I am yours to command, Your Grace. Always.\"" They were words he had to say, and so he said them, 
Page 29

apprehensive about what might come next. 
Robert scarcely seemed to hear him. \""Those years we spent in the Eyrie . . . gods, those were good 
years. I want you at my side again, Ned. I want you down in King's Landing, not up here at the end of 
the world where you are no damned use to anybody.\"" Robert looked off into the darkness, for a moment 
as melancholy as a Stark. \""I swear to 
you, sitting a throne is a thousand times harder than winning one. Laws are a tedious business and 
counting coppers is worse. And the people . . . there is no end of them. I sit on that damnable iron chair 
and listen to them complain until my mind is numb and my ass is raw. They all want something, money or 
land or justice. The lies they tell . . . and my lords and ladies are no better. I am surrounded by flatterers 
and fools. It can drive a man to madness, Ned. Half of them don't dare tell me the truth, and the other 
half can't find it. There are nights I wish we had lost at the Trident. Ah, no, not truly, but 
\""I understand,\"" Ned said softly. 
Robert looked at him. \""I think you do. If so, you are the only one, my old friend.\"" He smiled. \""Lord 
Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the King.\"" 
Ned dropped to one knee. The offer did not surprise him; what other reason could Robert have had for 
coming so far? The Hand of the King was the second-most powerful man in the Seven Kingdoms. He 
spoke with the king's voice, commanded the king's armies, drafted the king's laws. At times he even sat 
upon the Iron Throne to dispense king's justice, when the king was absent, or sick, or otherwise 
indisposed. Robert was offering him a responsibility as large as the realm itself. 
It was the last thing in the world he wanted. 
\""Your Grace,\"" he said. \""I am not worthy of the honor.\"" 
Robert groaned with good-humored impatience. \""If I wanted to honor you, I'd let you retire. I am 
planning to make you run the kingdom and fight the wars while I eat and drink and wench myself into an 
early grave.\"" He slapped his gut and grinned. \""You know the saying, about the king and his Hand?\"" 
Ned knew the saying. \""What the king dreams,\"" he said, \""the Hand builds.\"" 
\""I bedded a fishmaid once who told me the lowborn have a choicer way to put it. The king eats, they 
say, and the Hand takes the shit.\"" He threw back his head and roared his laughter. The echoes rang 
through the darkness, and all around them the dead of Winterfell seemed to watch with cold and 
disapproving eyes. 
Finally the laughter dwindled and stopped. Ned was still on one knee, his eyes upraised. \""Damn it, 
Ned,\"" the king complained. \""You might at least humor me with a smile.\"" 
\""They say it grows so cold up here in winter that a man's laughter freezes in his throat and chokes him to 
death,\"" Ned said evenly. \""Perhaps that is why the Starks have so little humor.\"" 
\""Come south with me, and I'll teach you how to laugh again,\"" the 
king promised. \""You helped me win this damnable throne, now help me hold it. We were meant to rule 
together. If Lyanna had lived, we should have been brothers, bound by blood as well as affection. Well, 
it is not too late. I have a son. You have a daughter. My Joff and your Sansa shall join our houses, as 
Page 30

Lyanna and I might once have done.\"" 
This offer did surprise him. \""Sansa is only eleven.\"" 
Robert waved an impatient hand. \""Old enough for betrothal. The marriage can wait a few years.\"" The 
king smiled. \""Now stand up and say yes, curse you.\"" 
\""Nothing would give me greater pleasure, Your Grace,\"" Ned answered. He hesitated. \""These honors are 
all so})"
"(:__Chunk__ {n_tokens: 1200,id: 9d653e659fe12af28edf219455e718f3,text: a shall join our houses, as

Lyanna and I might once have done.\"" 
This offer did surprise him. \""Sansa is only eleven.\"" 
Robert waved an impatient hand. \""Old enough for betrothal. The marriage can wait a few years.\"" The 
king smiled. \""Now stand up and say yes, curse you.\"" 
\""Nothing would give me greater pleasure, Your Grace,\"" Ned answered. He hesitated. \""These honors are 
all so unexpected. May I have some time to consider? I need to tell my wife . . .\"" 
\""Yes, yes, of course, tell Catelyn, sleep on it if you must.\"" The king reached down, clasped Ned by the 
hand, and pulled him roughly to his feet. \""Just don't keep me waiting too long. I am not the most patient 
of men.\"" 
For a moment Eddard Stark was filled with a terrible sense of foreboding. This was his place, here in the 
north. He looked at the stone figures all around them, breathed deep in the chill silence of the crypt. He 
could feel the eyes of the dead. They were all listening, he knew. And winter was coming. 
JON 
There were times-not many, but a few-when Jon Snow was glad he was a bastard. As he filled his wine 
cup once more from a passing flagon, it struck him that this might be one of them. 
He settled back in his place on the bench among the younger squires and drank. The sweet, fruity taste 
of surnmerwine filled his mouth and brought a smile to his lips. 
The Great Hall of Winterfell was hazy with smoke and heavy with the smell of roasted meat and 
fresh-baked bread. Its grey stone walls were draped with banners. White, gold, crimson: the direwolf of 
Stark, Baratheon's crowned stag, the lion of Lannister. A singer was playing the high harp and reciting a 
ballad, but down at this end of the hall his voice could scarcely be heard above the roar of the fire, the 
clangor of pewter plates and cups, and the low mutter of a hundred drunken conversations. 
It was the fourth hour of the welcoming feast laid for the king. Jon's brothers and sisters had been seated 
with the royal children, beneath the raised platform where Lord and Lady Stark hosted the king and 
queen. In honor of the occasion, his lord father would doubtless permit each child a glass of wine, but no 
more than that. Down here on the benches, there was no one to stop Jon drinking as much as he had a 
thirst for. 
And he was finding that he had a man's thirst, to the raucous delight of the youths around him, who urged 
him on every time he drained a glass. They were fine company, and Jon relished the stories they were 
telling, tales of battle and bedding and the hunt. He was certain that his companions were more 
entertaining than the king's offspring. He had sated his curiosity about the visitors when they made their 
entrance. The procession had passed not a foot from the place he had been given on the bench, and Jon 
had gotten a good long look at them all. 
His lord father had come first, escorting the queen. She was as beautiful as men said. A jeweled tiara 
gleamed amidst her long golden hair, its emeralds a perfect match for the green of her eyes. His father 
helped her up the steps to the dais and led her to her seat, but the queen never so much as looked at him. 
Even at fourteen, Jon could see through her smile. 
Page 31

Next had come King Robert himself, with Lady Stark on his arm. The king was a great disappointment 
to Jon. His father had talked of him often: the peerless Robert Baratheon, demon of the Trident, the 
fiercest warrior of the realm, a giant among princes. Jon saw only a fat man, red-faced under his beard, 
sweating through his silks. He walked like a man half in his cups. 
After them came the children. Little Rickon first, managing the long walk with all the dignity a 
three-year-old could muster. Jon had to urge him on when he stopped to visit. Close behind came Robb, 
in grey wool trimmed with white, the Stark colors. He had the Princess Myrcella on his arm. She was a 
wisp of a girl, not quite eight, her hair a cascade of golden curls under a jeweled net. Jon noticed the shy 
looks she gave Robb as they passed between the tables and the timid way she smiled at him. He decided 
she was insipid. Robb didn't even have the sense to realize how stupid she was; he was grinning like a 
fool. 
His half sisters escorted the royal princes. Arya was paired with plump young Tommen, whose 
white-blond hair was longer than hers. Sansa, two years older, drew the crown prince, Joffrey 
Baratheon. He was twelve, younger than Jon or Robb, but taller than either, to Jon's vast dismay. Prince 
Joffrey had his sister's hair and his mother's deep green eyes. A thick tangle of blond curls dripped down 
past his golden choker and high velvet collar. Sansa looked radiant as she walked beside him, but Jon 
did not like Joffrey's pouty lips or the bored, disdainful way he looked at Winterfell's Great Hall. 
He was more interested in the pair that came behind him})"
"(:__Chunk__ {n_tokens: 1200,id: 9a07266502329de08ceb4fb985c2a7f8,text:  than either, to Jon's vast dismay. Prince 
Joffrey had his sister's hair and his mother's deep green eyes. A thick tangle of blond curls dripped down 
past his golden choker and high velvet collar. Sansa looked radiant as she walked beside him, but Jon 
did not like Joffrey's pouty lips or the bored, disdainful way he looked at Winterfell's Great Hall. 
He was more interested in the pair that came behind him: the queen's brothers, the Lannisters of Casterly 
Rock. The Lion and the Imp; there was no mistaking which was which. Ser Jaime Lannister was 
twin to Queen Cersei; tall and golden, with flashing green eyes and a smile that cut like a knife. He wore 
crimson silk, high black boots, a black satin cloak. On the breast of his tunic, the lion of his House was 
embroidered in gold thread, roaring its defiance. They called him the Lion of Lannister to his face and 
whispered \""Kingslayer\"" behind his back. 
Jon found it hard to look away from him. This is what a king should look like, he thought to himself as 
the man passed. 
Then he saw the other one, waddling along half-hidden by his brother's side. Tyrion Lannister, the 
youngest of Lord Tywin's brood and by far the ugliest. All that the gods had given to Cersei and Jaime, 
they had denied Tyrion. He was a dwarf, half his brother's height, struggling to keep pace on stunted legs. 
His head was too large for his body, with a brute's squashed-in face beneath a swollen shelf of brow. 
One green eye and one black one peered out from under a lank fall of hair so blond it seemed white. Jon 
watched him with fascination. 
The last of the high lords to enter were his uncle, Benjen Stark of the Night's Watch, and his father's 
ward, young Theon Greyjoy. Benjen gave Jon a warm smile as he went by. Theon ignored him utterly, 
but there was nothing new in that. After all had been seated, toasts were made, thanks were given and 
returned, and then the feasting began. 
Jon had started drinking then, and he had not stopped. 
Something rubbed against his leg beneath the table. Jon saw red eyes staring up at him. \""Hungry again?\"" 
he asked. There was still half a honeyed chicken in the center of the table. Jon reached out to tear off a 
leg, then had a better idea. He knifed the bird whole and let the carcass slide to the floor between his 
legs. Ghost ripped into it in savage silence. His brothers and sisters had not been permitted to bring their 
wolves to the banquet, but there were more curs than Jon could count at this end of the hall, and no one 
Page 32

had said a word about his pup. He told himself he was fortunate in that too. 
His eyes stung. Jon rubbed at them savagely, cursing the smoke. He swallowed another gulp of wine and 
watched his direwolf devour the chicken. 
Dogs moved between the tables, trailing after the serving girls. One of them, a black mongrel bitch with 
long yellow eyes, caught a scent of the chicken. She stopped and edged under the bench to get a share. 
Jon watched the confrontation. The bitch growled low in her throat and moved closer. Ghost looked up, 
silent, and fixed the dog with those hot red eyes. The bitch snapped an angry challenge. She was three 
times the size of the direwolf pup. Ghost did not move. He stood 
over his prize and opened his mouth, baring his fangs. The bitch tensed, barked again, then thought 
better of this fight. She turned and slunk away, with one last defiant snap to save her pride. Ghost went 
back to his meal. 
Jon grinned and reached under the table to ruffle the shaggy white fur. The direwolf looked up at him, 
nipped gently at his hand, then went back to eating. 
\""Is this one of the direwolves I've heard so much of?\"" a familiar voice asked close at hand. 
Jon looked up happily as his uncle Ben put a hand on his head and ruffled his hair much as Jon had 
ruffled the wolf s. \""Yes,\"" he said. \""His name is Ghost.\"" 
One of the squires interrupted the bawdy story he'd been telling to make room at the table for their lord's 
brother. Benjen Stark straddled the bench with,long legs and took the wine cup out of Jon's hand. 
\""Summerwine,\"" he said after a taste. \""Nothing so sweet. How many cups have you had, Jon?\"" 
Jon smiled. 
Ben Stark laughed. \""As I feared. Ah, well. I believe I was younger than you the first time I got truly and 
sincerely drunk.\"" He snagged a roasted onion, dripping brown with gravy, from a nearby trencher and bit 
into it. It crunched. 
His uncle was sharp-featured and gaunt as a mountain crag, but there was always a hint of laughter in his 
blue-grey eyes. He dressed in black, as befitted a man of the Night's Watch. Tonight it was rich black 
velvet, with high leather boots and a wide belt with a silver buckle. A heavy silver chain was looped 
round his neck. Benjen watched Ghost with amusement as he ate his onion. \""A very quiet wolf})"

His uncle was sharp-featured and gaunt as a mountain crag, but there was always a hint of laughter in his 
blue-grey eyes. He dressed in black, as befitted a man of the Night's Watch. Tonight it was rich black 
velvet, with high leather boots and a wide belt with a silver buckle. A heavy silver chain was looped 
round his neck. Benjen watched Ghost with amusement as he ate his onion. \""A very quiet wolf,\"" he 
observed. 
\""He's not like the others,\"" Jon said. \""He never makes a sound. That's why I named him Ghost. That, and 
because he's white. The others are all dark, grey or black.\"" 
\""There are still direwolves beyond the Wall. We hear them on our rangings.\"" Benjen Stark gave Jon a 
long look. \""Don't you usually eat at table with your brothers?\"" 
\""Most times,\"" Jon answered in a flat voice. \""But tonight Lady Stark thought it might give insult to the 
royal family to seat a bastard among them.\"" 
\""I see.\"" His uncle glanced over his shoulder at the raised table at the far end of the hall. \""My brother 
does not seem very festive tonight.\"" 
Page 33

Jon had noticed that too. A bastard had to learn to notice things, to read the truth that people hid behind 
their eyes. His father was observing 
all the courtesies, but there was tightness in him that Jon had seldom seen before. He said little, 
looking out over the hall with hooded eyes, seeing nothing. Two seats away, the king had been drinking 
heavily all night. His broad face was flushed behind his great black beard. He made many a toast, 
laughed loudly at every jest, and attacked each dish like a starving man, but beside him the queen seemed 
as cold as an ice sculpture. \""The queen is angry too,\"" Jon told his uncle in a low, quiet voice. \""Father took 
the king down to the crypts this afternoon. The queen didn't want him to go.\"" 
Benjen gave Jon a careful, measuring look. \""You don't miss much, do you, Jon? We could use a man 
like you on the Wall.\"" 
Jon swelled with pride. \""Robb is a stronger lance than I am, but I'm the better sword, and Hullen says I 
sit a horse as well as anyone in the castle.\"" 
\""Notable achievements.\"" 
\""Take me with you when you go back to the Wall,\"" Jon said in a sudden rush. \""Father will give me leave 
to go if you ask him, I know he will.\"" 
Uncle Benjen studied his face carefully. \""The Wall is a hard place for a boy, Jon.\"" 
\""I am almost a man grown,\"" Jon protested. \""I will turn fifteen on my next name day, and Maester Luwin 
says bastards grow up faster than other children.\"" 
\""That's true enough,\"" Benjen said with a downward twist of his mouth. He took Jon's cup from the table, 
filled it fresh from a nearby pitcher, and drank down a long swallow. 
\""Daeren Targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered Dorne,\"" Jon said. The Young Dragon was 
one of his heroes. 
\""A conquest that lasted a summer,\"" his uncle pointed out. \""Your Boy King lost ten thousand men taking 
the place, and another fifty trying to hold it. Someone should have told him that war isn't a game.\"" He 
took another sip of wine. \""Also,\"" he said, wiping his mouth, \""Daeren Targaryen was only eighteen when 
he died. Or have you forgotten that part?\"" 
\""I forget nothing,\"" Jon boasted. The wine was making him bold. He tried to sit very straight, to make 
himself seem taller. \""I want to serve in the Night's Watch, Uncle.\"" 
He had thought on it long and hard, lying abed at night while his brothers slept around him. Robb would 
someday inherit Winterfell, would command great armies as the Warden of the North. Bran and Rickon 
would be Robb's bannermen and rule holdfasts in his name. His sisters Arya and Sansa would marry the 
heirs of other great houses 
and go south as mistress of castles of their own. But what place could a bastard hope to earn? 
\""You don't know what you're asking, Jon. The Night's Watch is a sworn brotherhood. We have no 
families. None of us will ever father sons. Our wife is duty. Our mistress is honor.\"" 
\""A bastard can have honor too,\"" Jon said. \""I am ready to swear your oath.\""

\""You are a boy of fourteen,\"" Benjen said. \""Not a man, not yet. Until you have known a woman, you 
cannot understand what you would be giving up.\"" 
\""I don't care about that!\"" Jon said hotly. 
\""You might, if you knew what it meant,\"" Benjen said. \""If you knew what the oath would cost you, you 
might be less eager to pay the price, son.\"" 
Jon felt anger rise inside him. \""I'm not your son!\"" 
Benjen Stark stood up. \""More's the pity.\"" He put a hand on Jon's shoulder. \""Come back to me after 
you've fathered a few bastards of your own, and we'll see how you feel.\"" 
Jon trembled. \""I will never father a bastard,\"" he said carefully. \""Never!\"" He spat it out like venom.

Benjen Stark stood up. \""More's the pity.\"" He put a hand on Jon's shoulder. \""Come back to me after 
you've fathered a few bastards of your own, and we'll see how you feel.\"" 
Jon trembled. \""I will never father a bastard,\"" he said carefully. \""Never!\"" He spat it out like venom. 
Suddenly he realized that the table had fallen silent, and they were all looking at him. He felt the tears 
begin to well behind his eyes. He pushed himself to his feet. 
\""I must be excused,\"" he said with the last of his dignity. He whirled and bolted before they could see him 
cry. He must have drunk more wine than he had realized. His feet got tangled under him as he tried to 
leave, and he lurched sideways into a serving girl and sent a flagon of spiced wine crashing to the floor. 
Laughter boomed all around him, and Jon felt hot tears on his cheeks. Someone tried to steady him. He 
wrenched free of their grip and ran, half-blind, for the door. Ghost followed close at his heels, out into the 
night. 
The yard was quiet and empty. A lone sentry stood high on the battlements of the inner wall, his cloak 
pulled tight around him against the cold. He looked bored and miserable as he huddled there alone, but 
Jon would have traded places with him in an instant. Otherwise the castle was dark and deserted. Jon 
had seen an abandoned holdfast once, a drear place where nothing moved but the wind and the stones 
kept silent about whatever people had lived there. Winterfell reminded him of that tonight. 
The sounds of music and song spilled through the open windows behind him. They were the last things 
Jon wanted to hear. He wiped 
away his tears on the sleeve of his shirt, furious that he had let them fall, and turned to go. 
\""Boy,\"" a voice called out to him. Jon turned. 
Tyrion Lannister was sitting on the ledge above the door to the Great Hall, looking for all the world like 
a gargoyle. The dwarf grinned down at him. \""Is that animal a wolf?\"" 
\""A direwolf,\"" Jon said. \""His name is Ghost.\"" He stared up at the little man, his disappointment suddenly 
forgotten. \""What are you doing up there? Why aren't you at the feast?\"" 
\""Too hot, too noisy, and I'd drunk too much wine,\"" the dwarf told him. \""I learned long ago that it is 
considered rude to vomit on your brother. Might I have a closer look at your wolf?\"" 
Jon hesitated, then nodded slowly. \""Can you climb down, or shall I bring a ladder?\"" 
\""Oh, bleed that,\"" the little man said. He pushed himself off the ledge into empty air. Jon gasped, then 
Page 35

watched with awe as Tyrion Lannister spun around in a tight ball, landed lightly on his hands, then vaulted 
backward onto his legs. 
Ghost backed away from him uncertainly. 
The dwarf dusted himself off and laughed. \""I believe I've frightened your wolf. My apologies.\"" 
\""He's not scared,\"" Jon said. He knelt and called out. \""Ghost, come here. Come on. That's it.\"" 
The wolf pup padded closer and nuzzled at Jon's face, but he kept a wary eye on Tyrion Lannister, and 
when the dwarf reached out to pet him, he drew back and bared his fangs in a silent snarl. \""Shy, isn't he?\"" 
Lannister observed. 
\""Sit, Ghost,\"" Jon commanded. \""That's it. Keep still.\"" He looked up at the dwarf. \""You can touch him 
now. He won't move until I tell him to. I've been training him.\"" 
\""I see,\"" Lannister said. He ruffled the snow-white fur between Ghost's ears and said, \""Nice wolf.\"" 
\""If I wasn't here, he'd tear out your throat,\"" Jon said. It wasn't actually true yet, but it would be. 
\""In that case, you had best stay close,\"" the dwarf said. He cocked his oversized head to one side and 
looked Jon over with his mismatched eyes. \""I am Tyrion Lannister.\"" 
\""I know,\"" Jon said. He rose. Standing, he was taller than the dwarf. It made him feel strange. 
\""You're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?\"" 
Jon felt a coldness pass right through him. He pressed his lips together and said nothing. 
\""Did I offend you?\"" Lannister said. \""Sorry. Dwarfs don't have to be tactful. Generations of capering fools 
in motley have won me the right to dress badly and say any damn thing that comes into my head.\"" He 
grinned. \""You are the bastard, though.\"" 
\""Lord Eddard Stark is my father,\"" Jon admitted stiffly. 
Lannister studied his face. \""Yes,\"" he said. \""I can see it. You have more of the north in you than your 
brothers.\"" 
\""Half brothers,\"" Jon corrected. He was pleased by the dwarf s comment, but he tried not to let it show. 
\""Let me give you some counsel, bastard,\"" Lannister said. \""Never forget what you are, for surely the 
world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armor yourself in it, and it 
will never be used to hurt you.\"" 
Jon was in no mood})"
"(:__Chunk__ {n_tokens: 1200,id: 66d365b9f233175744a2fc56c16a28cf,text:  in you than your 
brothers.\"" 
\""Half brothers,\"" Jon corrected. He was pleased by the dwarf s comment, but he tried not to let it show. 
\""Let me give you some counsel, bastard,\"" Lannister said. \""Never forget what you are, for surely the 
world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armor yourself in it, and it 
will never be used to hurt you.\"" 
Jon was in no mood for anyone's counsel. \""What do you know about being a bastard?\"" 
\""All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes.\"" 
\""You are your mother's trueborn son of Lannister.\"" 
\""Am I\"" the dwarf replied, sardonic. \""Do tell my lord father. MY mother died birthing me, and he's never 
Page 36

been sure.\"" 
\""I don't even know who my mother was,\"" Jon said. 
\""Some woman, no doubt. Most of them are.\"" He favored Jon with a rueful grin. \""Remember this, boy. 
All dwarfs may be bastards, yet not all bastards need be dwarfs.\"" And with that he turned and sauntered 
back into the feast, whistling a tune. When he opened the door, the light from within threw his shadow 
clear across the yard, and for just a moment Tyrion Lannister stood tall as a king. 
CATELYN 
0f all the rooms in Winterfell's Great Keep, Catelyn's bedchambers were the hottest. She seldom had to 
light a fire. The castle had been built over natural hot springs, and the scalding waters rushed through its 
walls and chambers like blood through a man's body, driving the chill from the stone halls, filling the glass 
gardens with a moist warmth, keeping the earth from freezing. Open pools smoked day and night in a 
dozen small courtyards. That was a little thing, in summer; in winter, it was the difference between life and 
death. 
Catelyn's bath was always hot and steaming, and her walls warm to the touch. The warmth reminded her 
of Riverrun, of days in the sun with Lysa and Edmure, but Ned could never abide the heat. The Starks 
were made for the cold, he would tell her, and she would laugh and tell him in that case they had certainly 
built their castle in the wrong place. 
So when they had finished, Ned rolled off and climbed from her bed, as he had a thousand times before. 
He crossed the room, pulled back the heavy tapestries, and threw open the high narrow windows one by 
one, letting the night air into the chamber. 
The wind swirled around him as he stood facing the dark, naked and empty-handed. Catelyn pulled the 
furs to her chin and watched him. He looked somehow smaller and more vulnerable, like the youth she 
had wed in the sept at Riverrun, fifteen long years gone. Her loins 
still ached from the urgency of his lovernaking. It was a good ache. She could feel his seed within her. 
She prayed that it might quicken there. It had been three years since Rickon. She was not too old. She 
could give him another son. 
\""I will refuse him,\"" Ned said as he turned back to her. His eyes were haunted, his voice thick with doubt. 
Catelyn sat up in the bed. \""You cannot. You must not.\"" 
\""My duties are here in the north. I have no wish to be Robert's Hand.\"" 
\""He will not understand that. He is a king now, and kings are not like other men. If you refuse to serve 
him, he will wonder why, and sooner or later he will begin to suspect that you oppose him. Can't you see 
the danger that would put us in?\"" 
Ned shook his head, refusing to believe. \""Robert would never harm me or any of mine. We were closer 
than brothers. He loves me. If I refuse him, he will roar and curse and bluster, and in a week we will 
laugh about it together. I know the man!\"" 
Page 37

\""You knew the man,\"" she said. \""The king is a stranger to you.\"" Catelyn remembered the direwolf dead in 
the snow, the broken antler lodged deep in her throat. She had to make him see. \""Pride is everything to a 
king, my lord. Robert came all this way to see you, to bring you these great honors, you cannot throw 
them back in his face.\"" 
\""Honors?\"" Ned laughed bitterly. 
\""In his eyes, yes,\"" she said. 
\""And in yours?\"" 
\""And in mine,\"" she blazed, angry now. Why couldn't he see? \""He offers his own son in marriage to our 
daughter, what else would you call that? Sansa might someday be queen. Her sons could rule from the 
Wall to the mountains of Dorne. What is so wrong with that?\"" 
\""Gods, Catelyn, Sansa is only eleven,\"" Ned said. \""And Joffrey . . . Joffrey is . . .\"" 
She finished for him. crown prince, and heir to the Iron Throne. And I was only twelve when my father 
promised me to your brother Brandon.\"" 
That brought a bitter twist to Ned's mouth. \""Brandon. Yes. Brandon would know what to do. He 
always did. It was all meant for Brandon. You, Winterfell, everything. He was born to be a King's Hand 
and a father to queens. I})"
"(:__Chunk__ {n_tokens: 1200,id: 4db535b52fd69762a38389e215cba59e,text:  . Joffrey is . . .\"" 
She finished for him. crown prince, and heir to the Iron Throne. And I was only twelve when my father 
promised me to your brother Brandon.\"" 
That brought a bitter twist to Ned's mouth. \""Brandon. Yes. Brandon would know what to do. He 
always did. It was all meant for Brandon. You, Winterfell, everything. He was born to be a King's Hand 
and a father to queens. I never asked for this cup to pass to me.\"" 
\""Perhaps not,\"" Catelyn said, \""but Brandon is dead, and the cup has passed, and you must drink from it, 
like it or not.\"" 
Ned turned away from her, back to the night. He stood staring out 
in the darkness, watching the moon and the stars perhaps, or perhaps the sentries on the wall. 
Catelyn softened then, to see his pain. Eddard Stark had married her in Brandon's place, as custom 
decreed, but the shadow of his dead brother still lay between them, as did the other, the shadow of the 
woman he would not name, the woman who had borne him his bastard son. 
She was about to go to him when the knock came at the door, loud and unexpected. Ned turned, 
frowning. \""What is it?\"" 
Desmond's voice came through the door. \""My lord, Maester Luwin is without and begs urgent 
audience.\"" 
\""You told him I had left orders not to be disturbed?\"" 
\""Yes, my lord. He insists.\"" 
\""Very well. Send him in.\"" 
Ned crossed to the wardrobe and slipped on a heavy robe. Catelyn realized suddenly how cold it had 
become. She sat up in bed and pulled the furs to her chin. \""Perhaps we should close the windows,\"" she 
suggested. 
Page 38

Ned nodded absently. Maester Luwin was shown in. 
The maester was a small grey man. His eyes were grey, and quick, and saw much. His hair was grey, 
what little the years had left him. His robe was grey wool, trimmed with white fur, the Stark colors. Its 
great floppy sleeves had pockets hidden inside. Luwin was always tucking things into those sleeves and 
producing other things from them: books, messages, strange artifacts, toys for the children. With all he 
kept hidden in his sleeves, Catelyn was surprised that Maester Luwin could lift his arms at all. 
The maester waited until the door had closed behind him before he spoke. \""My lord,\"" he said to Ned, 
\""pardon for disturbing your rest. I have been left a message.\"" 
Ned looked irritated. \""Been left? By whom? Has there been a rider? I was not told.\"" 
\""There was no rider, my lord. Only a carved wooden box, left on a table in my observatory while I 
napped. My servants saw no one, but it must have been brought by someone in the king's party. We 
have had no other visitors from the south.\"" 
\""A wooden box, you say?\"" Catelyn said. 
\""Inside was a fine new lens for the observatory, from Myr by the look of it. The lenscrafters of Myr are 
without equal.\"" 
Ned frowned. He had little patience for this sort of thing, Catelyn knew. \""A lens,\"" he said. \""What has 
that to do with me?\"" 
\""I asked the same question,\"" Maester Luwin said. \""Clearly there was more to this than the seeming.\"" 
Under the heavy weight of her furs, Catelyn shivered. \""A lens is an instrument to help us see.\"" 
\""Indeed it is.\"" He fingered the collar of his order; a heavy chain worn tight around the neck beneath his 
robe, each link forged from a different metal. 
Catelyn could feel dread stirring inside her once again. \""What is it that they would have us see more 
clearly?\"" 
\""The very thing I asked myself.\"" Maester Luwin drew a tightly rolled paper out of his sleeve. \""I found the 
true message concealed within a false bottom when I dismantled the box the lens had come in, but it is 
not for my eyes.\"" 
Ned held out his hand. \""Let me have it, then.\"" 
Luwin did not stir. \""Pardons, my lord. The message is not for you either. It is marked for the eyes of the 
Lady Catelyn, and her alone. May I approach?\"" 
Catelyn nodded, not trusting to speak. The maester placed the paper on the table beside the bed. It was 
sealed with a small blob of blue wax. Luwin bowed and began to retreat. 
\""Stay,\"" Ned commanded him. His voice was grave. He looked at Catelyn. \""What is it? My lady, you're 
shaking.\"" 
\""I'm afraid,\"" she admitted. She reached out and took the letter in trembling hands. The furs dropped 
Page 39

away from her nakedness, forgotten. In the blue wax was the moon-and-falcon seal of House Arryn. \""It's 
from Lysa.\"" Catelyn looked at her husband. \""It will not make us glad,\"" she told him. \""There is grief in this 
message, Ned. I can feel it.\"" 
Ned frowned, his face darkening. \""Open it.\"" 
Catelyn broke the seal. 
Her eyes moved over the words. At first they made no sense to her. Then she remembered. \""Lysa took 
no})"
"(:__Chunk__ {n_tokens: 1200,id: 5c8cf4e89f1bd2c11b298141036a6432,text:  of House Arryn. \""It's 
from Lysa.\"" Catelyn looked at her husband. \""It will not make us glad,\"" she told him. \""There is grief in this 
message, Ned. I can feel it.\"" 
Ned frowned, his face darkening. \""Open it.\"" 
Catelyn broke the seal. 
Her eyes moved over the words. At first they made no sense to her. Then she remembered. \""Lysa took 
no chances. When we were girls together, we had a private language, she and L\"" 
\""Can you read it?\"" 
\""Yes,\"" Catelyn admitted. 
\""Then tell us.\"" 
\""Perhaps I should withdraw,\"" Maester Luwin said. 
\""No,\"" Catelyn said. \""We will need your counsel.\"" She threw back the furs and climbed from the bed. 
The night air was as cold as the grave on her bare skin as she padded across the room. 
Maester Luwin averted his eyes. Even Ned looked shocked. \""What are you doing?\"" he asked. 
\""Lighting a fire,\"" Catelyn told him. She found a dressing gown and shrugged into it, then knelt over the 
cold hearth. 
\""Maester Luwin-\"" Ned began. 
\""Maester Luwin has delivered all my children,\"" Catelyn said. \""This is no time for false modesty.\"" She slid 
the paper in among the kindling and placed the heavier logs on top of it. 
Ned crossed the room, took her by the arm, and pulled her to her feet. He held her there, his face inches 
from her. \""My lady, tell me! What was this message?\"" 
Catelyn stiffened in his grasp. \""A warning,\"" she said softly. \""If we have the wits to hear.\"" 
His eyes searched her face. \""Go on.\"" 
\""Lysa says Jon Arryn was murdered.\"" 
His fingers tightened on her arm. \""By whom?\"" 
\""The Lannisters,\"" she told him. \""The queen.\"" 
Ned released his hold on her arm. There were deep red marks on her skin. \""Gods,\"" he whispered. His 
voice was hoarse. \""Your sister is sick with grief. She cannot know what she is saying.\"" 
\""She knows,\"" Catelyn said. \""Lysa is impulsive, yes, but this message was carefully planned, cleverly 
hidden. She knew it meant death if her letter fell into the wrong hands. To risk so much, she must have 
had more than mere suspicion.\"" Catelyn looked to her husband. \""Now we truly have no choice. You 
Page 40

must be Robert's Hand. You must go south with him and learn the truth.\"" 
She saw at once that Ned had reached a very different conclusion. \""The only truths I know are here. 
The south is a nest of adders I would do better to avoid.\"" 
Luwin plucked at his chain collar where it had chafed the soft skin of his throat. \""The Hand of the King 
has great power, my lord. Power to find the truth of Lord Arryn's death, to bring his killers to the king's 
justice. Power to protect Lady Arryn and her son, if the worst be true.\"" 
Ned glanced helplessly around the bedchamber. Catelyn's heart went out to him, but she knew she 
could not take him in her arms just then. First the victory must be won, for her children's sake. \""You say 
you love Robert like a brother. Would you leave your brother surrounded by Lannisters?\"" 
\""The Others take both of you,\"" Ned muttered darkly. He turned away from them and went to the 
window. She did not speak, nor did the maester. They waited, quiet, while Eddard Stark said a silent 
farewell to the home he loved. When he turned away from the window at last, his voice was tired and full 
of melancholy, and moisture glittered 
faintly in the corners of his eyes. \""My father went south once, to answer the summons of a king. He 
never came home again.\"" 
\""A different time,\"" Maester Luwin said. \""A different king.\"" 
\""Yes,\"" Ned said dully. He seated himself in a chair by the hearth. \""Catelyn, you shall stay here in 
Winterfell.\"" 
His words were like an icy draft through her heart. \""No,\"" she said, suddenly afraid. Was this to be her 
punishment? Never to see his face again, nor to feel his arms around her? 
\""Yes,\"" Ned said, in words that would brook no argument. \""You must govern the north in my stead, while 
I run Robert's errands. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. Robb is fourteen. Soon enough, he 
will be a man grown. He must learn to rule, and I will not be here for him. Make him part of your 
councils. He must be ready when his time comes.\"" 
\""Gods will, not for many years,\"" Maester Luwin murmured. 
\""Maester Luwin, I trust you as I would my own blood. Give my wife your voice in all things great and 
small. Teach my son the things he needs to know. Winter is coming.\"" 
Maester Luwin nodded gravely. Then silence fell, until Catelyn found her courage and asked the 
question whose answer she most dreaded. \""What of the other children?\"" 
Ned stood, and took her in his arms, and held her face close to his. \""Rickon is very young,\"" he})"
"(:__Chunk__ {n_tokens: 1200,id: ade2aa3b5edf4b1dc064ad3fff0ed255,text:  as I would my own blood. Give my wife your voice in all things great and 
small. Teach my son the things he needs to know. Winter is coming.\"" 
Maester Luwin nodded gravely. Then silence fell, until Catelyn found her courage and asked the 
question whose answer she most dreaded. \""What of the other children?\"" 
Ned stood, and took her in his arms, and held her face close to his. \""Rickon is very young,\"" he said 
gently. \""He should stay here with you and Robb. The others I would take with me.\"" 
\""I could not bear it,\"" Catelyn said, trembling. 
\""You must,\"" he said. \""Sansa must wed Joffrey, that is clear now, we must give them no grounds to 
suspect our devotion. And it is past time that Arya learned the ways of a southron court. In a few years 
she will be of an age to marry too.\"" 
Page 41

Sansa would shine in the south, Catelyn thought to herself, and the gods knew that Arya needed 
refinement. Reluctantly, she let go of them in her heart. But not Bran. Never Bran. \""Yes,\"" she said, \""but 
please, Ned, for the love you bear me, let Bran remain here at Winterfell. He is only seven.\"" 
\""I was eight when my father sent me to foster at the Eyrie,\"" Ned said. \""Ser Rodrik tells me there is bad 
feeling between Robb and Prince Joffrey. That is not healthy. Bran can bridge that distance. He is a 
sweet boy, quick to laugh, easy to love. Let him grow up with the young princes, let him become their 
friend as Robert became mine. Our House will be the safer for it.\"" 
He was right; Catelyn knew it. It did not make the pain any easier to bear. She would lose all four of 
them, then: Ned, and both girls, and 
her sweet, loving Bran. Only Robb and little Rickon would be left to her. She felt lonely already. 
Winterfell was such a vast place. \""Keep him off the walls, then,\"" she said bravely. \""You know how Bran 
loves to climb.\"" 
Ned kissed the tears from her eyes before they could fall. \""Thank you, my lady,\"" he whispered. \""This is 
hard, I know.\"" 
\""What of Jon Snow, my lord?\"" Maester Luwin asked. 
Catelyn tensed at the mention of the name. Ned felt the anger in her, and pulled away. 
Many men fathered bastards. Catelyn had grown up with that knowledge. It came as no surprise to her, 
in the first year of her marriage, to learn that Ned had fathered a child on some girl chance met on 
campaign. He had a man's needs, after all, and they had spent that year apart, Ned off at war in the south 
while she remained safe in her father's castle at Riverrun. Her thoughts were more of Robb, the infant at 
her breast, than of the husband she scarcely knew. He was welcome to whatever solace he might find 
between battles. And if his seed quickened, she expected he would see to the child's needs. 
He did more than that. The Starks were not like other men. Ned brought his bastard home with him, and 
called him \""son\"" for all the north to see. When the wars were over at last, and Catelyn rode to Winterfell, 
Jon and his wet nurse had already taken up residence. 
That cut deep. Ned would not speak of the mother, not so much as a word, but a castle has no secrets, 
and Catelyn heard her maids repeating tales they heard from the lips of her husband's soldiers. They 
whispered of Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, deadliest of the seven knights of Aerys's 
Kingsguard, and of how their young lord had slain him in single combat. And they told how afterward 
Ned had carried Ser Arthur's sword back to the beautiful young sister who awaited him in a castle called 
Starfall on the shores of the Summer Sea. The Lady Ashara Dayne, tall and fair, with haunting violet 
eyes. It had taken her a fortnight to marshal her courage, but finally, in bed one night, Catelyn had asked 
her husband the truth of it, asked him to his face. 
That was the only time in all their years that Ned had ever frightened her. \""Never ask me about Jon,\"" he 
said, cold as ice. \""He is my blood, and that is all you need to know. And now I will learn where you 
heard that name, my lady.\"" She had pledged to obey; she told him; and from that day on, the whispering 
had stopped, and Ashara Dayne's name was never heard in Winterfell again. 
Whoever Jon's mother had been, Ned must have loved her fiercely, for nothing Catelyn said would 
persuade him to send the boy away. It 
Page 42

was the one thing she could never forgive him. She had come to love her husband with all her heart, but 
she had never found it in her to love Jon. She might have overlooked a dozen bastards for Ned's sake, 
so long as they were out of sight. Jon was never out of sight, and as he grew, he looked more like Ned 
than any of the trueborn sons she bore him. Somehow that made it worse. \""Jon must go,\"" she said now.})"
"(:__Chunk__ {n_tokens: 1200,id: 361ecf2a5ec0f21852a28304bfcff884,text:  one thing she could never forgive him. She had come to love her husband with all her heart, but

\""He and Robb are close,\"" Ned said. \""I had hoped . . .\"" 
\""He cannot stay here,\"" Catelyn said, cutting him off. \""He is your son, not mine. I will not have him.\"" It 
was hard, she knew, but no less the truth. Ned would do the boy no kindness by leaving him here at 
Winterfell. 
The look Ned gave her was anguished. \""You know I cannot take him south. There will be no place for 
him at court. A boy with a bastard's name . . . you know what they will say of him. He will be shunned.\"" 
Catelyn armored her heart against the mute appeal in her husband's eyes. \""They say your friend Robert 
has fathered a dozen bastards himself.\"" 
\""And none of them has ever been seen at court!\"" Ned blazed. \""The Lann.ister woman has seen to that. 
How can you be so damnably cruel, Catelyn? He is only a boy. He-\"" 
His fury was on him. He might have said more, and worse, but Maester Luwin cut in. \""Another solution 
presents itself,\"" he said, his voice quiet. \""Your brother Benjen came to me about Jon a few days ago. It 
seems the boy aspires to take the black.\"" 
Ned looked shocked. \""He asked to join the Night's Watch?\"" 
Catelyn said nothing. Let Ned work it out in his own mind; her voice would not be welcome now. Yet 
gladly would she have kissed the maester just then. His was the perfect solution. Benjen Stark was a 
Sworn Brother. Jon would be a son to him, the child he would never have. And in time the boy would 
take the oath as well. He would father no sons who might someday contest with Catelyn's own 
grandchildren for Winterfell. 
Maester Luwin said, \""There is great honor in service on the Wall, my lord.\"" 
\""And even a bastard may rise high in the Night's Watch,\"" Ned reflected. Still, his voice was troubled. 
\""Jon is so young. If he asked this when he was a man grown, that would be one thing, but a boy of 
fourteen . . .\"" 
\""A hard sacrifice,\"" Maester Luwin agreed. \""Yet these are hard times, my lord. His road is no crueler 
than yours or your lady's.11 
Catelyn thought of the three children she must lose. It was not easy keeping silent then. 
Ned turned away from them to gaze out the window, his long face silent and thoughtful. Finally he 
sighed, and turned back. \""Very well,\"" he said to Maester Luwin. \""I suppose it is for the best. I will speak 
to Ben.\"" 
\""When shall we tell Jon?\"" the maester asked. 
\""When I must. Preparations must be made. It will be a fortnight before we are ready to depart. I would 
sooner let Jon enjoy these last few days. Summer will end soon enough, and childhood as well. When the 
Page 43

time comes, I will tell him myself.\"" 
ARYA 
A rya's stitches were crooked again. 
She frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister Sansa sat among the other 
girls. Sansa's needlework was exquisite. Everyone said so. \""Sansa's work is as pretty as she is,\"" Septa 
Mordane told their lady mother once. \""She has such fine, delicate hands.\"" When Lady Catelyn had asked 
about Arya, the septa had sniffed. \""Arya has the hands of a blacksmith.\"" 
Arya glanced furtively across the room, worried that Septa Mordane might have read her thoughts, but 
the septa was paying her no attention today. She was sitting with the Princess Myrcella, all smiles and 
admiration. It was not often that the septa was privileged to instruct a royal princess in the womanly arts, 
as she had said when the queen brought Myrcella to join them. Arya thought that Myrcella's stitches 
looked a little crooked too, but you would never know it from the way Septa Mordane was cooing. 
She studied her own work again, looking for some way to salvage it, then sighed and put down the 
needle. She looked glumly at her sister. Sansa was chatting away happily as she worked. Beth Cassel, 
Ser Rodrik's little girl, was sitting by her feet, listening to every word she said, and Jeyne Poole was 
leaning over to whisper something in her ear. 
\""What are you talking about?\"" Arya asked suddenly. 
Jeyne gave her a startled look, then giggled. Sansa looked abashed. Beth blushed. No one answered. 
\""Tell me,\"" Arya said. 
Jeyne glanced over to make certain that Septa Mordane was not listening. Myrcella said something then, 
and the septa laughed along with the rest of the ladies. 
\""We were talking about})"
"(:__Chunk__ {n_tokens: 1200,id: d32306604b40aa918394e8398bc27004,text:  whisper something in her ear. 
\""What are you talking about?\"" Arya asked suddenly. 
Jeyne gave her a startled look, then giggled. Sansa looked abashed. Beth blushed. No one answered. 
\""Tell me,\"" Arya said. 
Jeyne glanced over to make certain that Septa Mordane was not listening. Myrcella said something then, 
and the septa laughed along with the rest of the ladies. 
\""We were talking about the prince,\"" Sansa said, her voice soft as a kiss. 
Arya knew which prince she meant: Jofftey, of course. The tall, handsome one. Sansa got to sit with him 
at the feast. Arya had to sit with the little fat one. Naturally. 
\""Joffrey likes your sister,\"" Jeyne whispered, proud as if she had something to do with it. She was the 
daughter of Winterfell's steward and Sansa's dearest friend. \""He told her she was very beautiful.\"" 
\""He's going to marry her,\"" little Beth said dreamily, hugging herself. \""Then Sansa will be queen of all the 
realm.\"" 
Sansa had the grace to blush. She blushed prettily. She did everything prettily, Arya thought with dull 
resentment. \""Beth, you shouldn't make up stories,\"" Sansa corrected the younger girl, gently stroking her 
hair to take the harshness out of her words. She looked at Arya. \""What did you think of Prince Joff, 
sister? He's very gallant, don't you think?\"" 
\""Jon says he looks like a girl,\"" Arya said. 
Page 44

Sansa sighed as she stitched. \""Poor Jon,\"" she said. \""He gets jealous because he's a bastard.\"" 
\""He's our brother,\"" Arya said, much too loudly. Her voice cut through the afternoon quiet of the tower 
room. 
Septa Mordane raised her eyes. She had a bony face, sharp eyes, and a thin lipless mouth made for 
frowning. It was frowning now. \""What are you talking about, children?\"" 
\""Our half brother,\"" Sansa corrected, soft and precise. She smiled for the septa. \""Arya and I were 
remarking on how pleased we were to have the princess with us today,\"" she said. 
Septa Mordane nodded. \""Indeed. A great honor for us all.\"" Princess Myrcella smiled uncertainly at the 
compliment. \""Arya, why aren't you at work?\"" the septa asked. She rose to her feet, starched skirts 
rustling as she started across the room. \""Let me see your stitches.\"" 
Arya wanted to scream. It was just like Sansa to go and attract the septa's attention. \""Here,\"" she said, 
surrendering up her work. 
The septa examined the fabric. \""Arya, Arya, Arya,\"" she said. \""This will not do. This will not do at all.\"" 
Everyone was looking at her. It was too much. Sansa was too well bred to smile at her sister's disgrace, 
but Jeyne was smirking on her 
behalf. Even Princess Myrcella looked sorry for her. Arya felt tears filling her eyes. She pushed herself 
out of her chair and bolted for the door. 
Septa Mordane called after her. \""Arya, come back here! Don't you take another step! Your lady mother 
will hear of this. In front of our royal princess too! You'll shame us all!\"" 
Arya stopped at the door and turned back, biting her lip. The tears were running down her cheeks now. 
She managed a stiff little bow to Myrcella. \""By your leave, my lady.\"" 
Myrcella blinked at her and looked to her ladies for guidance. But if she was uncertain, Septa Mordane 
was not. \""Just where do you think you are going, Arya?\"" the septa demanded. 
Arya glared at her. \""I have to go shoe a horse,\"" she said sweetly, taking a brief satisfaction in the shock 
on the septa's face. Then she whirled and made her exit, running down the steps as fast as her feet would 
take her. 
It wasn't fair. Sansa had everything. Sansa was two years older; maybe by the time Arya had been born, 
there had been nothing left. Often it felt that way. Sansa could sew and dance and sing. She wrote 
poetry. She knew how to dress. She played the high harp and the bells. Worse, she was beautiful. Sansa 
had gotten their mother's fine high cheekbones and the thick auburn hair of the Tullys. Arya took after 
their lord father. Her hair was a lusterless brown, and her face was long and solemn. Jeyne used to call 
her Arya Horseface, and neigh whenever she came near. It hurt that the one thing Arya could do better 
than her sister was ride a horse. Well, that and manage a household. Sansa had never had much of a 
head for figures. If she did marry Prince Joff, Arya hoped for his sake that he had a good steward. 
Nymeria was waiting for her in the guardroom at the base of the stairs. She bounded to her feet as soon 
as she caught sight of Arya. Arya grinned. The wolf pup loved her, even if no one else did. They went 
everywhere})"

Nymeria was waiting for her in the guardroom at the base of the stairs. She bounded to her feet as soon 
as she caught sight of Arya. Arya grinned. The wolf pup loved her, even if no one else did. They went 
everywhere together, and Nymeria slept in her room, at the foot of her bed. If Mother had not forbidden 
Page 45

it, Arya would gladly have taken the wolf with her to needlework. Let Septa Mordane complain about 
her stitches then. 
Nymeria nipped eagerly at her hand as Arya untied her. She had yellow eyes. When they caught the 
sunlight, they gleamed like two golden coins. Arya had named her after the warrior queen of the Rhoyne, 
who had led her people across the narrow sea. That had been a great scandal too. Sansa, of course, had 
named her pup \""Lady.\"" Arya made a face and hugged the wolfling tight. Nymeria licked her ear, and she 
giggled. 
By now Septa Mordane would certainly have sent word to her lady mother. If she went to her room, 
they would find her. Arya did not care to be found. She had a better notion. The boys were at practice in 
the yard. She wanted to see Robb put gallant Prince Joffrey flat on his back. \""Come,\"" she whispered to 
Nymeria. She got up and ran, the wolf coming hard at her heels. 
There was a window in the covered bridge between the armory and the Great Keep where you had a 
view of the whole yard. That was where they headed. 
They arrived, flushed and breathless, to find Jon seated on the sill, one leg drawn up languidly to his chin. 
He was watching the action, so absorbed that he seemed unaware of her approach until his white wolf 
moved to meet them. Nymeria stalked closer on wary feet. Ghost, already larger than his litter mates, 
smelled her, gave her ear a careful nip, and settled back down. 
Jon gave her a curious look. \""Shouldn't you be working on your stitches, little sister?\"" 
Arya made a face at him. \""I wanted to see them fight.\"" 
He smiled. \""Come here, then.\"" 
Arya climbed up on the window and sat beside him, to a chorus of thuds and grunts from the yard 
below. 
To her disappointment, it was the younger boys drilling. Bran was so heavily padded he looked as 
though he had belted on a featherbed, and Prince Tommen, who was plump to begin with, seemed 
positively round. They were huffing and puffing and hitting at each other with padded wooden swords 
under the watchful eye of old Ser Rodrik Cassel, the master-at-arms, a great stout keg of a man with 
magnificent white cheek whiskers. A dozen spectators, man and boy, were calling out encouragement, 
Robb's voice the loudest among them. She spotted Theon Greyjoy beside him, his black doublet 
emblazoned with the golden kraken of his House, a look of wry contempt on his face. Both of the 
combatants were staggering. Arya judged that they had been at it awhile. 
\""A shade more exhausting than needlework,\"" Jon observed. 
\""A shade more fun than needlework,\"" Arya gave back at him. Jon grinned, reached over, and messed up 
her hair. Arya flushed. They had always been close. Jon had their father's face, as she did. They were the 
only ones. Robb and Sansa and Bran and even little Rickon all took after the Tullys, with easy smiles and 
fire in their hair. When Arya had been little, she had been afraid that meant that she was a bastard too. It 
been Jon she had gone to in her fear, and Jon who had reassured her. 
64 GEORGL R.R. MARTIN 
\""Why aren't you down in the yard?\"" Arya asked him. 
Page 46

He gave her a half smile. \""Bastards are not allowed to damage young princes,\"" he said. \""Any bruises 
they take in the practice yard must come from trueborn swords.\"" 
\""Oh.\"" Arya felt abashed. She should have realized. For the second time today, Arya reflected that life 
was not fair. 
She watched her little brother whack at Tommen. \""I could do just as good as Bran,\"" she said. \""He's only 
seven. I'm nine.\"" 
Jon looked her over with all his fourteen-year-old wisdom. \""You're too skinny,\"" he said. He took her 
arm to feel her muscle. Then he sighed and shook his head. \""I doubt you could even lift a longsword, little 
sister, never mind swing one.\"" 
Arya snatched back her arm and glared at him. Jon messed up her hair again. They watched Bran and 
Tommen circle each other. 
\""You see Prince Joffrey?\"" Jon asked. 
She hadn't, not at first glance, but when she looked again she found him to the back, under the shade of 
the high stone wall. He was surrounded by men she did not recognize, young squires in the livery of 
Lannister and Baratheon, strangers all. There})"

Tommen circle each other. 
\""You see Prince Joffrey?\"" Jon asked. 
She hadn't, not at first glance, but when she looked again she found him to the back, under the shade of 
the high stone wall. He was surrounded by men she did not recognize, young squires in the livery of 
Lannister and Baratheon, strangers all. There were a few older men among them; knights, she surmised. 
\""Look at the arms on his surcoat,\"" Jon suggested. 
Arya looked. An ornate shield had been embroidered on the prince's padded surcoat. No doubt the 
needlework was exquisite. The arms were divided down the middle; on one side was the crowned stag 
of the royal House, on the other the lion of Lannister. 
\""The Lannisters are proud,\"" Jon observed. \""You'd think the royal sigil would be sufficient, but no. He 
makes his mother's House equal in honor to the king's.\"" 
\""The woman is important too!\"" Arya protested. 
Jon chuckled. \""Perhaps you should do the same thing, little sister. Wed Tully to Stark in your arms.\"" 
\""A wolf with a fish in its mouth?\"" It made her laugh. \""That would look silly. Besides, if a girl can't fight, 
why should she have a coat of arms?\"" 
Jon shrugged. \""Girls get the arms but not the swords. Bastards get the swords but not the arms. I did not 
make the rules, little sister.\"" 
There was a shout from the courtyard below. Prince Tommen was rolling in the dust, trying to get up and 
failing. All the padding made him look like a turtle on its back. Bran was standing over him with upraised 
wooden sword, ready to whack him again once he regained his feet. The men began to laugh. 
\""Enough!\"" Ser Rodrik called out. He gave the prince a hand and 
yanked him back to his feet. \""Well fought. Lew, Donnis, help them out of their armor.\"" He looked 
around. \""Prince Joffrey, Robb, will you go another round?\"" 
Page 47

Robb, already sweaty from a previous bout, moved forward eagerly. \""Gladly.\"" 
Joffrey moved into the sunlight in response to Rodrik's summons. His hair shone like spun gold. He 
looked bored. \""This is a game for children, Ser Rodrik.\"" 
Theon Greyjoy gave a sudden bark of laughter. \""You are children,\"" he said derisively. 
\""Robb may be a child,\"" Joffrey said. \""I am a prince. And I grow tired of swatting at Starks with a play 
sword.\"" 
\""You got more swats than you gave, Joff,\"" Robb said. \""Are you afraid?\"" 
Prince Joffrey looked at him. \""Oh, terrified,\"" he said. \""You're so much older.\"" Some of the Lannister men 
laughed. 
Jon looked down on the scene with a frown. \""Joffrey is truly a little shit,\"" he told Arya. 
Ser Rodrik tugged thoughtfully at his white whiskers. \""What are you suggesting?\"" he asked the prince. 
\""Live steel.\"" 
\""Done,\"" Robb shot back. \""You'll be sorry!\"" 
The master-at-arms put a hand on Robb's shoulder to quiet him. \""Live steel is too dangerous. I will 
permit you tourney swords, with blunted edges.\"" 
Joffrey said nothing, but a man strange to Arya, a tall knight with black hair and burn scars on his face, 
pushed forward in front of the prince. \""This is your prince. Who are you to tell him he may not have an 
edge on his sword, ser?\"" 
\""Master-at-arms of Winterfell, Clegane, and you would do well not to forget it.\"" 
\""Are you training women here?\"" the burned man wanted to know. He was muscled like a bull. 
\""I am training knights,\"" Ser Rodrik said pointedly. \""They will have steel when they are ready. When they 
are of an age.\"" 
The burned man looked at Robb. \""How old are you, boy?\"" 
\""Fourteen,\"" Robb said. 
\""I killed a man at twelve. You can be sure it was not with a blunt sword.\"" 
Arya could see Robb bristle. His pride was wounded. He turned on Ser Rodrik. \""Let me do it. I can 
beat him.\"" 
\""Beat him with a tourney blade, then,\"" Ser Rodrik said. 
Joffrey shrugged. \""Come and see me when you're older, Stark. If you're not too old.\"" There was 
laughter from the Lannister men. 
Page 48

Robb's curses rang through the yard. Arya covered her mouth in shock. Theon Greyjoy seized Robb's 
arm to keep him away from the prince. Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers in dismay. 
Joffrey feigned a yawn and turned to his younger brother. \""Come, Tommen,\"" he said. \""The hour of play 
is done. Leave the children to their frolics.\"" 
That brought more laughter from the Lannisters, more curses from Robb. Ser Rodrik's face was 
beet-red with fury under the white of his whiskers. Theon kept Robb locked in an iron grip until the 
princes and their party were safely away})"

beet-red with fury under the white of his whiskers. Theon kept Robb locked in an iron grip until the 
princes and their party were safely away. 
Jon watched them leave, and Arya watched Jon. His face had grown as still as the pool at the heart of 
the godswood. Finally he climbed down off the window. \""The show is done,\"" he said. He bent to scratch 
Ghost behind the ears. The white wolf rose and rubbed against him. \""You had best run back to your 
room, little sister. Septa Mordane will surely be lurking. The longer you hide, the sterner the penance. 
You'll be sewing all through winter. When the spring thaw comes, they will find your body with a needle 
still locked tight between your frozen fingers.\"" 
Arya didn't think it was funny. \""I hate needlework!\"" she said with passion. \""It's not fair!\"" 
\""Nothing is fair,\"" Jon said. He messed up her hair again and walked away from her, Ghost moving 
silently beside him. Nymeria started to follow too, then stopped and came back when she saw that Arya 
was not coming. 
Reluctantly she turned in the other direction. 
It was worse than Jon had thought. It wasn't Septa Mordane waiting in her room. It was Septa Mordane 
and her mother. 
BRAN 
The hunt left at dawn. The king wanted wild boar at the feast tonight. Prince Joffrey rode with his father, 
so Robb had been allowed to join the hunters as well. Uncle Benjen, Jory, Theon Greyjoy, Ser Rodrik, 
and even the queen's funny little brother had all ridden out with them. It was the last hunt, after all. On the 
morrow they left for the south. 
Bran had been left behind with Jon and the girls and Rickon. But Rickon was only a baby and the girls 
were only girls and Jon and his wolf were nowhere to be found. Bran did not look for him very hard. He 
thought Jon was angry at him. Jon seemed to be angry at everyone these days. Bran did not know why. 
He was going with Uncle Ben to the Wall, to join the Night's Watch. That was almost as good as going 
south with the king. Robb was the one they were leaving behind, not Jon. 
For days, Bran could scarcely wait to be off. He was going to ride the kingsroad on a horse of his own, 
not a pony but a real horse. His father would be the Hand of the King, and they were going to live in the 
red castle at King's Landing, the castle the Dragonlords had built. Old Nan said there were ghosts there, 
and dungeons where terrible things had been done, and dragon heads on the walls. It gave Bran a shiver 
just to think of it, but he was not afraid. How could he be afraid? 
His father would be with him, and the king with all his knights and sworn swords. 
Page 49

Bran was going to be a knight himself someday, one of the Kingsguard. Old Nan said they were the 
finest swords in all the realm. There were only seven of them, and they wore white armor and had no 
wives or children, but lived only to serve the king. Bran knew all the stories. Their names were like music 
to him. Serwyn of the Mirror Shield. Ser Ryam Redwyne. Prince Aemon the Dragonknight. The twins 
Ser Erryk and Ser Arryk, who had died on one another's swords hundreds of years ago, when brother 
fought sister in the war the singers called the Dance of the Dragons. The White Bull, Gerold Hightower. 
Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. Barristan the Bold. 
Two of the Kingsguard had come north with King Robert. Bran had watched them with fascination, 
never quite daring to speak to them. Ser Boros was a bald man with a jowly face, and Ser Meryn had 
droopy eyes and a beard the color of rust. Ser Jaime Lannister looked more like the knights in the 
stories, and he was of the Kingsguard too, but Robb said he had killed the old mad king and shouldn't 
count anymore. The greatest living knight was Ser Barristan Selmy, Barristan the Bold, the Lord 
Commander of the Kingsguard. Father had promised that they would meet Ser Barristan when they 
reached King's Landing, and Bran had been marking the days on his wall, eager to depart, to see a world 
he had only dreamed of and begin a life he could scarcely imagine. 
Yet now that the last day was at hand, suddenly Bran felt lost. Winterfell had been the only home he had 
ever known. His father had told him that he ought to say his farewells today, and he had tried. After the 
hunt had ridden out, he wandered through the castle with his wolf at his side, intending to visit the ones 
who would be left behind, Old Nan and Gage the cook, Mikken in his smithy, Hodor the stableboy who 
smiled so much and took care of his pony and never said anything but \""Hodor,\"" the man in the glass 
gardens who})"
"(:__Chunk__ {n_tokens: 597,id: 54b1de37063a7e6986fd7c2b27b18ea9,text:  told him that he ought to say his farewells today, and he had tried. After the

smiled so much and took care of his pony and never said anything but \""Hodor,\"" the man in the glass 
gardens who gave him a blackberry when he came to visit . . . 
But it was no good. He had gone to the stable first, and seen his pony there in its stall, except it wasn't 
his pony anymore, he was getting a real horse and leaving the pony behind, and all of a sudden Bran just 
wanted to sit down and cry. He turned and ran off before Hodor and the other stableboys could see the 
tears in his eyes. That was the end of his farewells. Instead Bran spent the morning alone in the 
godswood, trying to teach his wolf to fetch a stick, and failing. The wolfling was smarter than any of the 
hounds in his father's kennel and Bran would 
have sworn he understood every word that was said to him, but he showed very little interest in chasing 
sticks. 
He was still trying to decide on a name. Robb was calling his Grey Wind, because he ran so fast. Sansa 
had named hers Lady, and Arya named hers after some old witch queen in the songs, and little Rickon 
called his Shaggydog, which Bran thought was a pretty stupid name for a direwolf. Jon's wolf, the white 
one, was Ghost. Bran wished he had thought of that first, even though his wolf wasn't white. He had tried 
a hundred names in the last fortnight, but none of them sounded right. 
Finally he got tired of the stick game and decided to go climbing. He hadn't been up to the broken tower 
for weeks with everything that had happened, and this might be his last chance. 
He raced across the godswood, taking the long way around to avoid the pool where the heart tree grew. 
The heart tree had always frightened him; trees ought not have eyes, Bran thought, or leaves that looked 
like hands. His wolf came sprinting at his heels. \""You stay here,\"" he told him at the base of the sentinel 
tree near the armory wall. \""Lie down. That's right. Now stay-\"" 
The wolf did as he was told. Bran scratched him behind the ears, then turned away, jumped, grabbed a 
low branch, and pulled himself up. He was halfway up the tree, moving easily from limb to limb, when the 
wolf got to his feet and began to howl.
