# GraphRAG - Graph-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation  

## Overview  
GraphRAG is a **graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** developed by **Microsoft Research**. It enhances retrieval and generative AI models by integrating knowledge graphs to represent and manage entity relationships. This approach improves the **contextual accuracy, relevance, and interpretability** of generated responses.

## Features  
- **Entity-Relationship Extraction**: Converts unstructured text into a structured **knowledge graph** for enhanced retrieval.  
- **Knowledge Graph Integration**: Uses **GraphML snapshots** to visualize entity connections.  
- **Supports GPT-based Retrieval**: Optimized for **GPT-4o-mini** to generate responses using enriched data sources.  
- **Improved Context Understanding**: Captures deeper relationships between entities for **more accurate** and **contextually aware** responses.
